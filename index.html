      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform.
        It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
        expose its features through declarative means.
        In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
        the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
        for scripting.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Use cases</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations model aims at three broad areas of application:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>User interface effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Animation can be used to give visual clues and feedback to make
              a user interface more readily comprehensible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a user action results in a table row being
              removed to represent an item being removed from a shopping cart.
              In such a case, fading the row to transparent and then shifting
              the subsequent rows up to fill the space over a few hundred
              milliseconds provides the user with clear feedback as to the
              results of their action as opposed to instantly removing the row
              from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this scenario not only are the animated effects of
              fading and shifting required, but so is synchronization, both
              between the animations, and between animations and scripted
              actions (removing the table row from the DOM after the animations
              have completed).
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Storytelling and visualisation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Another type of animation uses the animated effect to convey
              a story or represent some information.
              Unlike user interface effects which are largely a presentational
              adjunct to the content, these animations form an essential part of
              the content presented to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in an animated cartoon two cats fly through space
              to another planet leaving a rainbow trail behind them.
              After arriving at the planet a change of scene occurs and the user
              should decide whether or not the cats enter a magic mountain by
              selecting one of two preset destinations in the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              This scenario requires the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>animated effects for moving characters along a path as well as
                  warping a path (the rainbow trail),</li>
              <li>synchronization that allows some actions to happen
                  simultaneously (the two cats moving) and others in sequence
                  (the change of scene),</li>
              <li>play control to allow rewinding the cartoon, or changing its
                  playback rate to accommodate particular learning or
                  accessibility needs (particularly if audio or textual captions
                  are included as described in the next use case category),</li>
              <li>the ability to trigger alternate animations at different
                  points in the overall story.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Similar use cases in this category include visualising physical
              phenomena such as spring motion for educational purposes,
              or visualising data such as the prevalence of a disease over
              a geographical space over a year whereby animation is used to
              present the time-based component of the data.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Synchronizing media and animated effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Finally, animation is often used in conjunction with other media
              such as video and audio.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, the subtitles shown on a karaoke video may indicate
              the current position in the lyrics through a ball bouncing from
              one syllable to the next.
              In this scenario it is necessary to maintain strict
              synchronization between the audio and animation even in the face
              of user interaction such as rewinding or pausing the audio or
              network events such as a delay due to media buffering.
            </p>
            <p>
              A more complicated example of this category is applying a series
              of independent sound effects to an animated cartoon or adding
              a video as the background of an animated scene such that is cued
              to start mid-way into the scene.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The nature of these uses cases differs significantly and whilst Web
          Animations attempts to address each use case, technologies built on
          top of the Web Animations may expose features tailored towards more
          specific use cases rather catering to each scenario equally.
        </p>

        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a Web page.
          Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
          they are described in different terms.
          This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
          encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
          This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
          specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
          without any observable change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defining CSS Transitions, CSS Animations and SVG's animation features
          in terms of a common model opens up possibilities of synchronizing
          animations, interchanging their definitions, and manipulating them
          using a common programming interface regardless of their markup.
          To facilitate this process of redefining these features in terms of
          a common model, this specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding
          specification, which describes how CSS features can be implemented in
          terms of Web Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification
          which does the same for SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
          Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]].
          It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
          the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
          Animation can be removed.
          To this end, features not present in Web Animations that are part of
          SVG are described in full in the SVG and Web Animations integration
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programming interface component of this specification makes
          some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [[HTML5]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Overview of this specification</h3>
        <p>
          This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
          This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
          abstract model.
          The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
          and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

      <h2>Web Animations model overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
        independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
        model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces
        the values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100
            pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width
        for the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
        the animation model.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is independent
          of previous inputs, the model may be described as stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are a few apparent exceptions to the stateless behavior of the
          timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, events are fired when, for example, one sample falls
          on the opposite side of an animation's interval boundary to the
          previous sample.
          This is certainly stative behavior.
          However, events should be considered as a layer added on top of the
          core timing model.
          When no event listeners are registered, the model is stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other exception to this stateless behavior is that a number of
          methods defined in the <a href="#script-interface">programming
          interface</a> to the model provide play control such as pausing and
          reversing an item.
          These methods are defined in terms of the time at which they are
          called and are therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but, like events, are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the <a
          href="#script-interface">programming interface</a>, it has no
          influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not conflict with
          the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
          down a number of steps to each animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A hierarchy of timing nodes.
          Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.
          At the root of the tree is the global clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
          on, as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent
          cascade down to its descendants.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          animations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Timing model concepts</h2>
      <p>
        In Web Animations timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
        between timing nodes.
        Parent nodes provide timing information to their child nodes in the form
        of <a title="time value">time values</a>.
        A <dfn>time value</dfn> is a real number which nominally represents
        a number of seconds from some moment.
        The connection between <a title="time value">time values</a> and
        wall-clock seconds may be obscured by any number of transformations
        applied to the value as it passes through the time hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        In the future we may have timelines that are based on UI gestures in
        which case the connection between time values and seconds will be
        weakened even further.
      </p>

      <h2>The global clock</h2>
      <p>
        At the root of the Web Animations timing hierarchy is the <a>global
        clock</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>global clock</dfn> is a source of monotonically increasing <a
        title="time value">time values</a> unaffected by adjustments to the
        system clock.
        The <a title="time value">time values</a> produced by the <a>global
        clock</a> represent wall-clock seconds from an unspecified historical
        moment.
        The absolute value of the <a title="time value">time values</a> produced
        by the <a>global clock</a> are insignificant, only their rate of change.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that the <a>global clock</a> is not exposed in the <a
        href="#script-interface">programming interface</a> and nor is it
        expected to be exposed by markup.
        As a result the moment from which <a>global clock</a> <a title="time
        value">time values</a> are measured, that is, the zero time of the
        clock, is allowed to be implementation-dependent.
        One user agent may measure the number of seconds since the the user
        agent was loaded whilst another may use the time when the device was
        started.
        Both approaches are acceptable and produce no observable difference
        in the output of the model.

      <h2>Timelines</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>timeline</dfn> provides a source of <a title="time value">time
        values</a> for the purpose of synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, a <a>timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a> such
        that its absolute time is calculated as a fixed offset from the time of
        the <a>global clock</a>.
        This offset is established by designating some moment as the timeline's
        <dfn>zero time</dfn> and recording the <a>time value</a> of the
        <a>global clock</a> at that moment.
        At subsequent moments, the <a>time value</a> of the timeline is
        calculated as the difference between the current <a>time value</a> of
        the <a>global clock</a> and the value recorded at the <a>zero time</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        Note that we anticipate that other types of timelines may be introduced
        in the future that are not tied to the global clock.
        For example, a timeline whose time values correspond to UI gestures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a <a>timeline</a> may be defined to relative a moment that has yet
        to occur, it may not always be able to return a meaningful <a>time
        value</a>.
        A <a>timeline</a> is considered to be <dfn>not started</dfn> when it is
        in such a state that it cannot produce a <a>time value</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The document timeline</h3>
        <p>
          Each document has a <a>timeline</a> called the <dfn>document
          timeline</dfn> whose <a>time value</a> at a given moment is calculated
          as a fixed offset from the <a>global clock</a> such that its <a>zero
          time</a> corresponds to the moment immediately prior to dispatching
          the load event of the document.
          Prior to this moment, the <a>document timeline</a> is <a>not
          started</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For documents that support the concept of <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
          ">current document readiness</a>, this is the moment after the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
          ">current document readiness</a> has changed to "complete" but
          before dispatching the load event.
          For user agents that support Navigation Timing [[NAVIGATION-TIMING]],
          this occurs between the <em>domComplete</em> and
          <em>loadEventStart</em> timings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the <a>document timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a>
          by a fixed offset, <a title="time value">time values</a> reported by
          the <a>document timeline</a> increase monotonically.
          Furthermore, since no scaling is applied, these <a title="time
          value">time values</a> represent wall-clock seconds.

          The children of a <a>timeline</a> are called <em>players</em>.
          A player takes a <a>timed item</a> which is a static description of
          some timed behavior and binds it to a <a>timeline</a> so that it runs.
          A player also allows run-time control of the connection between the
          <a>timed item</a> and its <a>timeline</a> by providing pausing,
          seeking, and speed control.
          The relationship between a player and a <a>timed item</a> is analogous
          to that of a DVD player and a DVD.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A <dfn>player</dfn> connects a single <a>timed item</a>, called its
        <dfn>source content</dfn>, to a <a>timeline</a> and provides playback
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>player</a> records the <a>time value</a> of its <a>timeline</a>
        at which its <a>source content</a> is scheduled to begin

      <section>
        <h3>The current time of a player</h3>
        <p>
          <a title="player">Players</a> also provide a <a>time value</a> to
          their <a>source content</a> called the player's <dfn>current
          time</dfn>.
          The calculation of the <a>current time</a> is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><a>current time</a> =
          (<var>timeline time</var> - <a title="player start time">start

          - <a>time drift</a></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time value</a> of the
          <a>timeline</a> with which this <a>player</a> is associated.</li>
          <li><var>start time</var> is the player's <a

          <li><var>playback rate</var> is the <a

        </ul>
        <p>
          If the <a>timeline</a> with which is <a>player</a> is <a>not

        </p>
        <p>
          It is often useful to treat the <a>current time</a> as zero when it
          would otherwise be <code>null</code>.
          Hence we define the <dfn>effective current time</dfn> as being equal
          to <a>current time</a> unless it is <code>null</code>, in which case
          the <var>effective current time</var> be zero.</li>

        <h3>Seeking and pausing</h3>
        <p>
          Seeking and pausing a player are closely related and are described
          here together.
        </p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to seeking</h4>
          <p>
            Changing the current playback position of a player can be used to
            rewind its <a>source content</a> to its start point, fast-forward
            to a point in the future, or to provide ad-hoc synchronization
            between timed items.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in Web Animations, the <a title="player start time">start
            time</a> of a <a>player</a> has special significance in determining
            the priority of animations (see <a href="#combining-animations"
            class="sectionRef"></a>) and so we cannot simply adjust the <a
            title="player start time">start time</a>.
            Instead, an additional offset is introduced called the <a>time
            drift</a> that further offsets a player's <a>current time</a> from
            its timeline.
            The effect of the <a>time drift</a> when seeking is illustrated
            below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/seeking.svg" width="600">
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            At time <var>t</var>, a seek is performed on the player changing its
            <a>current time</a> from 1.5s to 2s.<br>
            As a result, the <a>time drift</a> is set to -0.5s.<br>
            Note that the <a title="player start time">start time</a> indicated
            by a red star does not change.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible to seek a player even if its <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            Once the timeline begins, the player will being playback from the
            seeked time.

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to pausing</h4>
          <p>
            Pausing can be used to temporarily suspend a <a>player</a>.
            Like seeking, pausing effectively causes the <a>current time</a> of
            a player to be offset from its <a>timeline</a> by means of
            setting the <a>time drift</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pausing before a player's <a title="player start time">start
            time</a> will cause the player's <a>source content</a> to begin in
            a paused state but does not delay its start as is illustrated below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">

            The effect of pausing a player at different moments.<br>
            In case A, the player is paused and unpaused before its <a>start
            time</a>.
            The pause has no effect.<br><br>
            In case B, the player is paused before the
            <a title="player start time">start time</a> and remains paused.
            At the scheduled <a title="player start time">start time</a> the
            <a>source content</a> begins playing in a paused state.
            When the player is unpaused it continues playing.
            The resulting player has a <a>time drift</a> equivalent to the
            interval from the <a title="player start time">start time</a> to
            when it was unpaused.<br><br>
            In case C, the player is paused and unpaused during the <a>active
            interval</a> of the source content.
            After unpausing, the player has a <a>time drift</a> equivalent to
            the duration of the pause interval.

          <h4>Seeking and pausing properties</h4>
          <p>
            <a title="player">Players</a> track three properties related to
            seeking and pausing.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>time drift</dfn></dt>
            <dd>

              pausing.
              The <a>time drift</a> is initially zero and is updated as per the
              definition in <a href="#calculating-the-time-drift"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </dd>

          <p>
            A number of calculations for performing seeking and pausing are
            defined to operate even when the associated <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            For such situations we define the <dfn>effective timeline time</dfn>
            as the current <a>time value</a> of the <a>timeline</a> associated
            with a <a>player</a>;
            if the timeline is <a>not started</a>, then the <var>effective
            timeline time</var> is zero.

        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Calculating the <a>time drift</a></h4>
          <p>
            The <a>time drift</a> value is both a stored and a calculated value.
            When a player is paused, the value is calculated from the <a>pause
            start time</a>.
            When a player is not paused, the stored value is used.
            The stored value is initially zero, and is updated when the player
            is unpaused or seeked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since pausing does not take effect prior to when a player's source
            content begins, we first define the beginning of a player's source
            content for the purposes of pausing as a player's <em>earliest
            moment</em>.
            The calculation is as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <dfn>earliest moment</dfn> = <code>min(0, <var>start delay of
            source content</var>)</code>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="issue">
            I'm pretty sure we don't want this behavior now that the player is
            separate to the source content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this definition we can define the value of <a>time drift</a>
            at a given moment as follows:
          </p>
          <dl class="switch">
            <dt>If the <a>paused state</a> is true,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the result of 
              <code>(<a>effective timeline time</a> - <a
              title="player start time">start time</a>) * <a
              title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> -
              max(<a>pause start time</a>, <a>earliest moment</a>)</code>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the stored value for this property.

        <section>
          <h4>Updating the <a>paused state</a></h4>
          <p>
            The procedure for updating the <a>paused state</a> is as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Let <var>new value</var> be the new paused state to set.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>new value</var> equals the current <a>paused state</a>,
              return.
            </li>
            <li>
              The next step depends on the current <a>paused state</a> as
              follows,
              <dl class="switch">

                  <em>current calculated</em> value of <a>time drift</a> as
                  defined in <a href="#calculating-the-time-drift"
                  class="sectionRef"></a>.

                <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
                <dd>
                  Record the current value of the <a>effective current time</a>

            <dfn>Seeking</dfn> is the process of updating a player's <a>current
            time</a> to a desired value.
            It is achieved using the following procedure:

            The rate of play of a player can be controlled by setting its
            <em>playback rate</em>.
            For example, setting a playback rate of 2 will cause the player's
            <a>current time</a> to increase at twice the rate of its
            <a>timeline</a>.
            Similarly, a playback rate of -1 will cause the player's <a>current
            time</a> to decrease at the same rate as the <a title="time
            value">time values</a> from its <a>timeline</a> increase.
          </p>
          <p>

          The <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> is initially 1.

      <h2>Timed items</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, if set, is a type of
        <dfn>timed item</dfn>.
        There are three types of <a>timed item</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a title="animation">animations</a>,</li>
        <li><a title="timing group">timing groups</a>, and</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> can be associated with at most
        one <a>player</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a title="timed item">Timed items</a> can be chained together into
        a hierarchy using <a title="timing group">timings groups</a> in which
        case a <a>timed item</a> may be <dfn>indirectly associated</dfn> with
        a <a>player</a> via an ancestor <a>timing group</a>.
        Only the root <a>timed item</a> of such a hierarchy can be associated
        directly with a <a>timed item</a>.
        Attempting to associate a <a>timed item</a> that has a <a>parent timing

        removed from the <a>parent timing group</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All types of <a>timed item</a> define a number of common properties.

        <h3>The active interval</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The period that a <a>timed item</a> is scheduled to run is called
            the <a>active interval</a>.
            Each <a>timed item</a> has only one such interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is determined by the
            <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> of the <a>timed
            item</a> but may be shifted by a <a>start delay</a> on the <a>timed

          </p>
          <p>
            The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>active

        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is defined by the

        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a>'s <dfn title="timed item start time">start

          any, has scheduled the <a>timed item</a> to begin.
          It is expressed in <a>inherited time</a>.
          In most cases, including the case when the <a>timed item</a> has no
          <a>parent timing group</a>, the <a title="timed item start time">start

          In addition to the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>,
          a <a>timed item</a> also has a <dfn>start delay</dfn> which is an

          Unlike the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> which is
          determined by the <a>parent timing group</a>, the <a>start delay</a>
          is a property of the <a>timed item</a> itself.

        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval<a> of a <a>timed item</a>,

          <p>
            These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
            follows:

              This state is only used in conjunction with the

                Assuming a monotonically increasing <a>timeline</a>, in the

      <h2>Fill behavior</h2>
      <p>
        The effect of a <a>timed item</a> outside its <a>active interval</a> is
        determined by its <dfn>fill mode</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        The normative definition of these modes is incorporated in the

      <h2>Repeating</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Iteration intervals</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that a timed item should repeat
          a fixed number of times or indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, a timed item can have multiple
          <a title="iteration interval">iteration intervals</a> although
          typically only the interval corresponding to the <a>current
          iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <dfn>iteration
          duration</dfn>.
          The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of a timed item is simply its
          <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of a timed item is zero,
          however some specific types of timed item such as timing groups
          override this behavior and provide an alternative intrinsic duration
          (see <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-parallel-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-sequence-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>iteration duration</a> of a <a>timed item</a> may be set by the
          author to represent a value other than the <a>intrinsic iteration
          duration</a>.

        <h3>Controlling iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The number of times a <a>timed item</a> repeats is called its
          <dfn>iteration count</dfn>.
          The <a>iteration count</a> is a real number greater than or equal to
          zero.
          The <a>iteration count</a> may also be positive infinity to represent
          that the <a>timed item</a> repeats indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a>iteration count</a>, <a title="timed item">timed
          items</a> also have an <dfn>iteration start</dfn> property which
          specifies an offset into the series of iterations at which the
          <a>timed item</a> should begin.
          The <a>iteration start</a> is a finite real number greater than or
          equal to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior of these parameters is defined in the calculations in <a
          href="#core-timed-item-calculations" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The effect of the <a>iteration count</a> and <a>iteration start</a>

            parameters.<br>
            In the first case the <a>iteration count</a> is 2.5 resulting in the
            third iteration being cut-off half way through its <a>iteration
            interval</a>.<br>
            The second case is the same but with an <a>iteration start</a> of
            0.5.
            This causes the <a>timed item</a> to begin half way through the
            first iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the <a>iteration count</a> parameter, the <a>iteration

        <h3>Iteration time space</h3>
        <p>
          We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
          <a>local time and inherited time</a> (see <a
          href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Iteration time space</em> is a time space whose zero time is the
          beginning of a timed item's current iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <a>active
          time</a> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
          interval.
          This time space, however, is internal to the model and not exposed in
          the script interface or in markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          These time spaces are illustrated below.

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
          Animations defines <a>active time</a> and <a>iteration
          time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <em>active time space</em>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>active time</a> defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-active-time" class="sectionRef"></a> will
          never return a negative value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
          <em>document time space</em> which is time space of the <a title="time
          value">time values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> of the <a

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          When a timed item repeats we must define the behavior at the iteration
          boundaries.
          For this and indeed for all interval-timing, Web Animations uses an
          endpoint-exclusive timing model.
          This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
          In interval notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>.
          This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
          sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated item, at local time 1s,
          the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced items, at inherited time 1s, only item B will be
          <a>active</a>; there is no overlap.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a

        Like <a title="player">players</a>, <a title="timed item">timed
        items</a> also have a <dfn title="timed item playback rate">playback
        rate</dfn> parameter.
        The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of a <a>timed
        item</a> is a finite real number that acts as a multiplier when
        calculating the <a>timed item</a>'s <a>transformed time</a> from its
        <a>local time</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback
        rate</a> of a <a>timed item</a> differs from the setting the <a
        title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on a player.
        Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in <a

      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In summary, the behaviour of the <a title="timed item playback

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> is applied
            only to the <a>active interval</a> of a <a>timed item</a> and not to

          </li>
          <li>
            Setting a negative <a title="timed item playback rate">playback

            begin at the end of its <a>active interval</a>.
            This differs from the <a title="player playback rate">playback
            rate</a> on a <a>player</a>.
            Setting a <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on
            a <a>player</a> to a negative value at a moment before the
            <a>player</a>'s </a>source content</a> has begun, will result in the
            <a>source content</a> never playing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of
            a <a>timed item</a> affects the calculated value of the <a>active

              of a <a>timed item</a> whose <a>local time</a> is within its
              <a>active interval</a> will cause it to jump.
              This is because the <a>active duration</a> will be updated but the
              <a>local time</a> will not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, if other <a title="timed item">timed items</a> depend

            </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
          takes an <a>inherited time</a> value and converts it to an
          <a>iteration time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this further transformations are applied before resulting at
          a final <a>transformed time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in this process is to calculate the boundary when the
          <a>timed item</a> is <a>active</a>, that is, the <a>active
          duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is illustrated below.

          Calculation of the <a>active duration</a> is based on
          multiplying the <a>iteration duration</a> by the <a>iteration

          (4) The <a>scaled active time</a> is then converted to an offset
          within a single iteration: the <a>iteration time</a>.<br>
          (5) The <a>iteration time</a> is converted into a <a>directed time</a>

        <h3>Scaling the time</h3>
        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which a <a>timed item</a>
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the <a>timed item</a> to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides a variety of <a
          title="timing function">timing functions</a> that scale the progress
          of a <a>timed item</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a title="timing function">Timing functions</a> take an input time

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
            curve to scale the time.
            The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0,0) and (1,1) while two
            control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of
            the curve.
            Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
            lie within the range [0,1] such a curve produces a function that is
            used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
            (the <var>y</var> values).
            This arrangement is illustrated below.

        <p>
          While it is possible to set the timing properties of <a title="timed
          item">timed items</a> individually, it is often useful to synchronize
          <a title="timed item">timed items</a> so that they share common timing
          properties and maintain their temporal relationship.
          This is achieved using a <a>timing group</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple example is illustrated below.

        A <dfn>timing group</dfn> is a type of <a>timed item</a> that contains
        an ordered sequence of zero or more <a title="timed item">timed
        items</a> known as <dfn title="child timed item">child timed
        items</dfn>.
        At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> may be a <a>child timed item</a>
        of at most one <a>timing group</a> known as the <dfn>parent timing
        group</dfn>.
        Furthermore, the <a>parent timing group</a> cannot be the same <a>timed
        item</a> as the <a>child timed item</a> itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temporal relationship between a <a>child timed item</a> and its
        <a>parent timing group</a> is incorporated in the definition of
        <a>inherited time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of a <a>timing group</a> is based on the
          timing of the group.
          Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <a>transformed time</a>.
          With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
          <em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <a>timing group</a> has an <a>iteration count</a> of
          2, then the children of of the group will all play twice since they
          effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an <a>timing group</a> base their timing on the
          group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
          children play again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that even in this case, the child <a title="timed item">timed
          items</a> still have only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
          However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
          interval</a> is played twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
          as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
          count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
          of the children.

          that child playing 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further result of the children of a <a>timing group</a> basing their
          timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they cannot
          animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
          This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
          change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
          This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.

          However, when a similar <a>timed item</a> is placed inside a <a>timing
          group</a> with a specified <a>iteration duration</a> it has the effect

      <h2>Animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        An <dfn>animation effect</dfn> takes a <a>time fraction</a> and

        <a>animation value</a> for its <a>target property</a>.
        Each <a>animation</a> may have at most one <a>animation effect</a>
        associated with it.

        Since the result of an <a>animation effect</a> is based on the

          Should this be called <em>effect value</em>?
          <em>animation value</em> is quite generic and is likely to be used

          <em>effect value</em> emphasises that this is the output of a single

      <h2>Key frame animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>key frame animation effect</dfn> is an <a>animation effect</a>
        that produces <a title="animation value">animation values</a> for
        a property by interpolating between a series of property values
        positioned at fractional offsets in the range [0,1].
      </p>
      <p>
        Each pair of a property value and a corresponding offset is called
        a <dfn>key frame</dfn>.
        A <a>key frame</a> may also provide an optional <a>timing function</a>
        which scales the <a>timing fraction</a> values between the <a>key
        frame</a> and the next <a>key frame</a> in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, due to a <a>timing function</a> specified on either the <a>timed
        item</a> from which the <a>time fraction</a> is derived or on an
        individual <a>key frame</a>, the scaled <a>time fraction</a> lies
        outside the range [0,1], the specified <a>key frame</a> property values
        are extrapolated to cover the extended range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The behavior when <a title="key frame">key frames</a> overlap or have
        unsupported values is defined in the following section, <a

        <h3>The iteration value of a key frame animation effect</h3>
        <p>
          The <a>iteration value</a> of a <a>key frame animation effect</a> for
          a given <a>time fraction</a> is calculated as follows.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the target property of the effect is not <a>animatable</a>
              abort the procedure since the effect cannot be applied.</li>
          <li>Let <var>key frames</var> be the list of <a title="key frame">key
              frames</a> specified on the effect.</li>
          <li>Let <var>time fraction</var> be the <a>time fraction</a> for which
              the <a>iteration value</a> is to be calculated.</li>
          <li>Let <var>underlying value</var> be the current <a>underlying
              value</a> provided by the <a>compositor</a>.
          <li>Sort <var>key frames</var> using a <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability">stable
              sort</a> such that the <a>key frame</a> offsets are in ascending
              order.</li>
          <li>Remove any <a title="key frame">key frames</a> from <var>key
              frames</var> whose offset is outside the range [0,1].</li>
          <li>Remove any <a title="key frame">key frames</a> from <var>key

          <li>If <var>key frames</var> is an empty list, return <var>underlying
              value</var>.</li>
          <li>If there is no <a>key frame</a> with offset of 0, create a new key
              frame with an offset 0, a property value set to <var>underlying
              value</var>, and no <a>timing function</a> and add it to the
              beginning of <var>key frames</var>.
              <p class="issue">
                This behavior is currently under discussion.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Similarly, if there is no <a>key frame</a> with offset of 1,
              create a new key frame with an offset 1, a property value set to

              append it to the end of <var>key frames</var>.</li>
          <li>If <var>time fraction</var> is less zero and there is more than
              one <a>key frame</a> in <var>key frames</var> with offset 0,
              return the property value of the first <a>key frame</a> in
              <var>key frames</var>.</li>
          <li>If <var>time fraction</var> is greater than or equal to 1 and
              there is more than one <a>key frame</a> in <var>key frames</var>
              with offset of 1, return the property value of the last <a>key
              frame</a> in <var>key frames</var>.</li>
          <li>Let <var>start key frame</var> be the last <a>key frame</a> in
              <var>key frames</var> whose offset is less than or equal to
              <var>time fraction</var> and less than 1.
              If there is no such <a>key frame</a> (because, for example,
              the <a>time fraction</a> is negative), let <var>start key
              frame</var> be the last <a>key frame</a> whose offset is 0.</li>
          <li>Let <var>end key frame</var> be the next <a>key frame</a> in
              <var>key frames</var> after <var>start key frame</var>.</li>

              differ in <a>property type</a> or have the same <a>property

              then return the property value of <var>start key frame</var>
              unless <var>time fraction</var> is greater than or equal to 1, in

          <li>Let <var>start offset</var> be the offset of <var>start key

                  as the input to the funcion.

        <p class="note">
          Note that this procedure permits overlapping <a title="key frame">key

          The behavior is that at the point of overlap the output value jumps to
          the value of last defined <a>key frame</a> at that offset.
          For overlapping frames at 0 or 1, the output value for <a
          title="time fraction">time fractions</a> less than 0 or greater than

          the <a title="animation value">animation values</a> of each

          from lowest to highest priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each step in the process of evaluating an <a>animation stack</a> takes
          an <dfn>underlying value</dfn> as input.
          The initial <a>underlying value</a> is the <a>base value</a> of the

        <p>
          For each <a>animation effect</a> in the stack, the <a>animation
          value</a> of the <a>animation effect</a> is combined with the
          <a>underlying value</a> and produces a new value.
          This resulting value becomes the <a>underlying value</a> for combining
          the next <a>animation effect</a> in the stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final value of an <a>animation stack</a>, called the
          <dfn>composited value</dfn>, is simply the result of the final
          (highest priority) <a>animation effect</a> in the stack.

            The application of an <a>animation stack</a> occurs within a wider

        <p>
          Applying animation to a property depends on establishing an
          <a>override stylesheet</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>override stylesheet</dfn> contains output animation values
          and acts with a higher priority than all other stylesheets.
          However, <code>!important</code> rules from all other stylesheets act
          with a higher priority than the override stylesheet.
          The <a>override stylesheet</a> is regenerated each time the

      <h3>Custom animation effects</h3>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In some situations the animation effects provided by Web Animations
          may be insufficient.
          For example, the animation effects defined here are only able to
          target certain CSS properties and DOM attributes.
          They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
          property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
          affecting the document content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases where the provided animation effects do not provide
          needed functionality, an animation effect defined by script may be
          used.
          Such animation effects receive a time fraction from the timing
          model and are responsible for producing the animation effect
          corresponding to the specified time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using an animation effect defined in script it is possible to
          animate not only previously un-animatable attributes and properties,
          but potentially anything that is accessible via script, including
          even producing audio or creating vibrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, using an animation effect that draws to a <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
          element it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
          featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
          SVG.
          Compared to using the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
          interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
          independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
          accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
          in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
          additional programming.
        </p>
      </div> <!-- informative -->
      <div class="annotation">
        <p>
          I think we want two types of custom animation effects.
          Following is the general-purpose animate-anything kind of effect.
          The other type, which is not defined here, is the one that can
          participate in the animation sandwich just like any other.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, second, native-like animation effect, would have the
          following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shares the same function signature as
              <code><a>AnimationEffect</a>.sample</code></li>
          <li>Gets passed the underlying value and passes out the animated
              value.</li>
          <li>Has a target attribute and is sorted against other
              <a>AnimationEffect</a> objects (including platform
              objects)</li>
          <li>Can be added as a child of
              a <a>GroupedAnimationEffect</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That's a bit more difficult since you have to be careful that the
          custom effect doesn't do anything naughty while you're in the
          middle of compositing the animation sandwich.
          I think we should postpone this until Web Animations 2.

        <h4>Execution order of custom animation effects</h4>
        <p>
          Custom animation effects allow authors to define animation effects
          using script.
          Such animation effects are not limited to a single CSS property or
          DOM attribute and therefore the steps for assessing their order of
          execution differs from regular animation effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom animation effects are executed after all other
          <a>AnimationEffect</a> objects have completed and applied their
          effects to their targets.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Need to define this more precisely.
          Are styles flushed?
          Presumably they are.
          Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
          animation effects and just do it once afterwards?
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the set of custom animation effects, the order of execution
          is mostly the same as that for other animation effects and is
          defined in <a href="#the-global-animation-stack"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
          However, custom animation effects may also override this
          ordering through the <code>priority</code> attribute, which, if
          defined, specifies the priority of the effects with lower numbers
          are executed sooner.
        </p>
        <p>
          In deciding which of two <a>CustomAnimationEffect</a> objects,
          <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, should be executed the following
          rules are applied.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> based on their
              <code>priority</code> such that lower priorities are sorted
              first.
              If either does not have a defined <code>priority</code>,
              then treat the priority as being positive infinity for the
              purposes of sorting.</li>
          <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority,
              sort according to the <code>startTime</code>s of the
              <a>TimedItem</a>s with which <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are
              associated such that earlier start times are sorted first.
          <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority and
              start time, sort by the position of the corresponding
              <a>Animation</a> objects occur within the animation tree (see
              issue below).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Items sorted earlier, are executed first.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          That last point is quite wrong. I don't think we've specified
          exactly what script order is in <a
          href="#the-global-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          But I wonder if it makes more sense to effectively enumerate all the
          script-based nodes in the animation tree using some well-defined
          order and use that index.
          Can that be done efficiently?

              The <code>playbackRate</code> and <code>paused</code> attributes

                  In this case the error is because <em>other</em> does not have

              A finite real number greater than or equal to zero representing
              the number of iterations into the timed item at which to begin.
              For example, a value of 0.5 would cause the timed item to begin

              Note that in a future version <a>AnimationTarget</a> may be

              Therefore, code that is intended to be used with arbitrary
              <a>Animation</a> objects should test the concrete type of
              <code>target</code> before using it and not assume that it refers
              to an Element.

            <p class="issue">
              If SVG is extended to allow multiple targets (using, e.g.,
              <code>select="rect"</code>) then it might be most natural to
              represent that in the API but allowing the <code>target</code> to
              refer to multiple elements.
              It's something that deserves attention for version 1.

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The second parameter representing the animation effect may specify
            multiple properties, an <a>AnimationEffect</a> object, or even
            a callback object.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 3);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animB = new Animation(elem, animA.effect, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem, new PathAnimationEffect( ... ), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem,
  { 
    sample: function(time) { 
      if (time !== null) {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
      } else {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0;
      }
    },
    clone: function { return this; }
  }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p class="todo">
            Fill in the parameters for <a>PathAnimationEffect</a> above once
            we have decided on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third parameter representing the animation's timing, may
            simply be a number representing the <a>iteration duration</a> as
            above, or, to specify further timing properties such as the <a
            title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a>,
            a <a>TimingDictionary</a> can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is also possible to omit the timing parameter altogether in which
            case default timing values will be used.
            Since the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an animation is
            zero, and the default <code>fillMode</code> when constructing an
            <a>Animation</a> is <em>forwards</em>, it is possible to
            create animations that simply set a property without any
            interpolation as follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' });
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is particularly useful in combination with other <a
            title="animation">animations</a> or <a title="timed item">timed
            items</a>.
            For example, fading an element before switching
            &lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
            follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new SeqGroup(
  [
    new Animation(elem, { opacity: '0%' }, 1),
    new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' })
  ]
);
          </pre>
          <p>
            Having created an <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a> it
            can be played using
            <code>document.timeline.play(<var>anim</var>)</code>.
            For simple effects the <a
            href="#extensions-to-the-element-interface"><code>Element.animate</code></a>
            shortcut is more convenient since it performs this last step
            automatically.

        <h3>The <code>PseudoElement</code> interface</h3>
        <p>
          Since <a title="animation">animations</a> may also target
          pseudo-elements, Web Animations API introduces the

          <p>
            This is an interface that may be useful in other specifications and
            so there are a few considerations to bear in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Currently no validation is performed at all.
                You can set <code>pseudoElement</code> to
                &lsquo;<code>::batman</code>&rsquo; and we'll just ignore it
                when compositing (still need to define this).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is in order to provide better fallback.
                For example, if a UA doesn't support a particular pseudo-element
                it will still run the animation in terms of occupying time and
                firing events.
                There simply won't be any visual effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, we have a general pattern in this specification that
                constructors don't throw.
              </p>
              <p>
                So while this works for this API, is this behavior useful in
                other specifications?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The other issue is that we could just make <a>PseudoElement</a>
                have an optional <code>pseudoElement</code> attribute and use
                that everywhere instead of a union of <a>Element</a> or
                <a>PseudoElement</a> (see <a>AnimationTarget</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason we don't is that it complicates the 99% case where
                you're not using pseudo-elements. For example, you have to type
                <code>anim.target.element</code> which is what so many people
                don't like about SVG.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, again, this works for this specification, but is it ok for
                others?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              While we're at it, should we enforce using double-colons somehow?
            </li>

                Note that this method requires handling the passed in parameter
                in a manner not yet supported by Web IDL and hence this method

                Since accessing the properties of an ECMAScript user object can
                have side effects, the manner in which these properties is
                accessed is important.
                In light of this consideration the following procedure has the
                following properties:

                <li>Every property is read only once.</li>

        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Should this be a dictionary?
          I'd like to make <code>clone</code> optional.

                The distance within a single iteration of the animation effect
                of the current sample.
                When this is <code>null</code>, the callback object SHOULD
                remove the animation effect.

        <p class="issue">
          Do we need to pass in the <a>TimedItem</a> as well?
          If possible I'd prefer not to but it may necessary for some types of
          effect.
          Might be an additional parameter to add later if it proves
          necessary?
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          I think we will also need to pass the previous time fraction.
          Animations will often use this to check if they are paused, playing
          in reverse etc.
          They can track this themselves but then you need a separate object
          everywhere you use it.

      <h2>Timing events</h2>
      <p>
        As timed items play they report changes to their status through
        <a>TimingEvent</a>s.
      </p>
      <div class="annotation">
        <p><strong>Relationship to CSS and SVG events</strong></p>
        <p>
          CSS defines <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s and SVG defines <code>TimeEvent</code>s.
          The proposal here is to dispatch <a>TimingEvent</a>s in parallel to
          these events.
          This has the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is possible to register for <em>just</em> CSS animation events,
          or <em>just</em> CSS transition events, or <em>just</em> SVG time
          events, or <em>all</em> animation-related events
          (by registering for the timing events defined here).</li>
          <li>Backwards compatibility&mdash;existing content continues to work
          as is.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An alternative is to make CSS and SVG events subclass
          <a>TimingEvent</a> and just fire the one event.
          Two issues arrive with this.
          Firstly, the event type would change on the subclasses so it wouldn't
          be possible to catch all "start" events, for example.
          Secondly, the propagation path for SVG events is different since they
          are fired at the animation template element rather than the animation
          target element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there may be alternative approaches here such as
          augmenting CSS Animation events only and firing them from the API
          (although that may cause compatibility issues when SVG animations
          start reporting events to content expecting only CSS animations).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="todo">
        Clarify somewhere that timing events are a property of the <em>timing
        model</em> hence they continue to fire even if there is no animation
        effect and even if the target property is in a <code>display:
        none</code> block.

            <div class="annotation">
              <p>
                I think document time will be much more useful than global time.
                For the rarer case that you want to synchronise animations
                between documents using events, I anticipate
                <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> will have a method to convert
                a document to global time and vice-versa and/or convert times
                from one <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> to another
                <a>DocumentTimeSource</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we come to define animations that aren't necessarily linked
                to a document time source we'll need to make this nullable or
                redefine it to mean "root time source".
              </p>
            </div>

              the <a>TimedItem</a> is associated when the event was dispatched.
              For animations that do not belong to an <a>TimingGroup</a> this
              will be equal to <code>documentTime</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="annotation">
              If we allow animations to be associated with, for example,
              MediaControllers, we'll need to revise the above description to
              cover more than just <a>TimingGroup</a>s.

              This is the same time space used for <code>startTime</code> and
              <code>endTime</code>.
              This is the most useful time space if, for example, you receive
              a timing event and want to add a new animation that synchronises
              with the item that dispatched the event by adding it to the same
              time source (e.g. group).

        <div class="annotation">
          <p>
            Other potential event types for a later version:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>pause</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever <code>paused</code> is newly true.<br>
              Use case: show a graphic overlay to mark a cartoon as paused.<br>
              Likewise <em>unpause</em>.</li>
            <li><em>seek</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever <code>currentTime</code> is set on the item or an
              ancestor.<br>
              Use case: Acts as a signal that intermediate events may have been
              dropped (see <a href="#event-dispatch-during-seeking"
              class="sectionRef"></a>).
              For example, if you have an iteration event handler that assumes
              it will get one call per iteration, then a seek event would be
              a cue that you need to check <code>iterationIndex</code> and
              adjust.
              Also, if you were implementing something like SVG's syncbase
              timing with script you often need to do some bookkeeping on
              a seek.
            </li>
            <li><em>directionchange</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever the effective direction of the item changes (due to
              the direction attribute, changes to playbackRate, calling reverse
              etc. on either the item or an ancestor)<br>
              Use case: update UI to represent rewinding;
              stop audio when playing backwards to prevent secretly encoded
              messages being revealed.
            </li>
            <li><em>newanimation</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever a new <a>Animation</a> object is created.
              Use case: a timeline debugger. You want to show all animations
              that are playing or yet-to-play.
              Using this event (and <code>document.getCurrentAnimations</code>?)
              you could build up a timegraph.
              <p>
                I think this sort of event and this sort of use case would fit
                the MutationObserver pattern well.
                We could introduce a whole class of mutation records targetted
                at debugging (e.g. <em>timewindowchange</em>)
              </p>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, although this is a bit different to a regular event (since
            it's qualified by a parameter), it seems like it might be nice to be
            able to do something like:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
            anim.onprogress(0.8,
             function() {
              // Issue a request to prefetch the next episode
             });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It would be called whenever you got a sample where
            <code>iterationTime</code> &ge; <var>progress</var> was newly true.

        <h4>Event dispatch</h4>
        <p>
          The <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#glossary-propagation-path">propagation
          path</a> for all events depends on the <a>TimedItem</a> where the
          status change took place.
          If the item is an <a>Animation</a> with a <code>target</code> that is
          not <code>null</code>, the propagation path follows the usual <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow">DOM event
          flow</a> from <code>DefaultView</code> down the parent chain to
          <code>target</code> and finally to the
          <a>TimedItem</a> where the status change took place.
          Otherwise, the propagation path is simply the <code>TimedItem</code>
          object itself.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that unlike <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s in CSS, and <code>TimeEvent</code>s in
          SVG which target an Element, the target of a <a>TimingEvent</a> is
          a <a>TimedItem</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Web Animations makes no guarantees about the time between
          successive frames of animation, it is possible that the time when
          a change in state that should produce an event is scheduled to occur
          does not line up with a frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, the events that should be dispatched when sampling the model
          is based on the interval between samples as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let <var>previous sample</var> be the moment when the timing model
            was last sampled, recorded in document time.
            If there was no previous sample, then let <var>previous sample</var>
            be -1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>current sample</var> be the current document time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>progress interval</var> be the interval (<var>previous
            sample</var>, <var>current sample</var>].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The events to be dispatched are therefore those whose document time
          lies within <var>progress interval</var>.
        </p>
        <div class="todo">
          <p>
            I think we will need to make sample times per-timed item.
            Then, if we have a timed item that has a previous sample, but can't
            get the current time (because it has no timeline), then we fire
            a timingcancel event.
          </p>
          <p>
            That way, you can switch players and their source content around and
            you'll only get a cancel event if on the next sample the timed item
            is not connected to a player.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time for the cancel event would be the time of the previous
            sample.

            This description fails to account for newly-added animations,
            removed animations, and other tree surgery.
            For example, if I have a sample at t=3s, I add an animation whose
            animation interval starts at t=2s, and then conduct another sample
            at t=4s, the <em>timingstart</em> event should fire even though the
            event's document time lies outside the progress interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could possibly fix this by making the previous sample times and
            current sample times per-<a>TimedItem</a> but that won't work for
            repeating groups.
            Needs work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            This last part here requires calculating document times (both for
            testing against the progress interval and also for filling in the
            <code>documentTime</code> attribute of the event) and that's hard to
            calculate since our current model allows non-invertible timing
            functions on groups.
            That means you can't easily just traverse the descendants (by child
            and iteration) and generate a list of interval and iteration
            boundaries then filter out the ones that don't fit in the interval
            because you can't easily convert from local time to document time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can, of course, convert from document time to local time
            and while that's probably enough to tell if there was an interval or
            iteration edge or not, it's not enough to determine the exact time
            at which it occurred (to fill in the event parameters).
          </p>
          <p>
            A complex example is where you have an group whose iteration time
            goes from 0 to 1.5 to 0.7 back to 1.
            Suppose you have a child animation that finishes its animation
            interval at 80% of the way through the parent's iteration interval.
            It would then finish, do nothing, then start reversing part-way,
            then finish again.
            In that case I think you expect to get: start, finish, start,
            finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's probably not impossible, so long as we allow for the fact that
            the inverse may have several (even equal) roots but it sounds tricky
            and possibly expensive to calculate on each iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think we might need to re-consider allowing non-invertible timing
            functions on groups.
            Alternatively we could say that the children of a group with
            a non-interval timing function don't generate events.
            Or, alternatively again, that they occur on the non-transformed
            times.
          </p>
          <p>
            This final options of making event times untransformed times is not
            such a bad option, especially if we split time transformations into
            a separate step and perhaps even a separate interface.
            It's similar to some vector graphics editing programs that provide
            bitmap filter effects&mdash;often the bounding box of the filtered
            shape reflects the dimensions of the vector shape and not that of
            the bitmapped result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, in the case of an animation that bounces back and forth before
            resting at its final value, it's probably more useful to get just
            one end event when it finally rests than lots of little end/start
            events each time it crosses the 1.0 iteration time boundary.

        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            One implementation issue with events is that sometimes you find you
            suddenly have a large backlog of events to dispatch and this may
            have an adverse impact on performance.
            Some such situations include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have a short iteration duration, e.g. 50ms, then you get put
              in a background tab and throttled really low.
              On the next sample, you might have hundreds of iteration events to
              dispatch.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have an arrangement of animations such that they keep spawning
              new ones for ever.
              You can easily get this in SVG using syncbase timing or in the
              model here by using repeating groups.
              In this case, you can have a lot of events to dispatch if you get
              throttled low.
              Once you have a global clock, you also encounter this situation
              when the computer goes to sleep since when it wakes up it will
              have a lot of start/end/iteration events to catch up on.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It seems like the Mutation Observer pattern might help here except,
            firstly, that might prevent simple usage such as:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate({ opacity: '0%' }, 1).onend =
   function() { elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem); };
          </pre>
          <p>
            Secondly, even using the observer pattern doesn't relieve the
            implementation of having to walk through the model and determine
            all the mutations that have occured and their corresponding times
            and this could be expensive if the computer has been asleep for
            a few days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option might be to set some implementation requirements that
            allow dropping events or automatic pausing when the time between
            samples is protracted (such as the device going to sleep).

        <h3>Event dispatch during seeking</h3>
        <p>
          The previous description of event dispatch applies when the timing
          model is sampled during normal playback (whether forwards or
          backwards).
          However, when a seek is performed by setting the
          <code>currentTime</code> of a <a>TimedItem</a>,
          a different behavior is employed.
          In effect, event dispatch is supressed until the seek is completed.
          After the seek has completed, events are dispatched based on comparing
          the before and after state of each <a>TimedItem</a> affected by the
          seek.
          Iteration events are not dispatched.
        </p>
        <p class="annotation">
          Supressing events during seeking is necessary to provide performant
          seeking.
          It is also arguably the more intuitive behavior as, for example,
          when rewinding a cartoon one probably does not expect a bucketload of
          events to arrive as a result of traversing backwards over each
          <a>TimedItem</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Should iteration events be dispatched?
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Prior to performing the seek on <var>item</var>,
              record whether it is <a>active</a> or not.</li>
          <li>If <var>item</var> is an <a>TimingGroup</a> record whether each
              descendent <a>TimedItem</a> is <a>active</a> or not.</li>
          <li>Perform the seek as described in <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
          <li>For each <a>TimedItem</a> considered in steps 2 and 3, compare
              whether the item was <a>active</a> before the seek and
              whether it is <a>active</a> now and dispatch events as follows:
              <dl class="switch">
                <dt>If the item was previously <a>active</a> but, after seeking,
                    is no longer <a>active</a>,</dt>
                <dd>Dispatch a new <code>timingend</code> event with
                  <a>localTime</a> set to <code>endTime</code> and
                  <a>documentTime</a> set to the corresponding document
                  time.
                  <span class="todo">(Obviously this depends on being able
                    to convert from a local time to a document time as
                    discussed in the previous section.)
                </dd>
                <dt>If the item was previously not <a>active</a> but, after
                    seeking, is now <a>active</a>,</dt>
                <dd>Dispatch a new <code>timingstart</code> event with
                  <a>localTime</a> set to <code>startTime
                  + timing.startDelay + timeDrift</code> and
                  <a>documentTime</a> set to the corresponding document
                  time.

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The sequence of dispatched events is identical to that of events
          dispatched during regular sampling (see <a href="#sequence-of-events"

          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#sync-async">synchronous
          events</a> whose sequence is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Events are ordered by <code>documentTime</code></li>
          <li>For events with the same <code>documentTime</code>,
              sort by event type from first to last as follows:
              <em>timingcancel</em>, <em>timingend</em>,
              <em>timingiteration</em>, <em>timingstart</em>.
              <p class="note">
                Note that sorting end events before start events is consistent
                with the end-point exclusive nature of timing in Web
                Animations (see <a href="#interval-timing"
                class="sectionRef"></a>).
                When animation A ends at the same time as animation B begins,
                we can imagine that animation A ends an incredibly short amount
                of time before animation B begins such that there is no overlap.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            For events with the same <code>documentTime</code> and type,
            if the target <a>TimedItem</a>s participate in a tree made up of
            <a>TimingGroup</a>s then the events are dispatched as if the tree
            was sampled breadth-first such that events attached to ancestor
            <a>TimedItem</a>s are dispatched first.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="issue">
          What if the order is still unresolved, is it okay to leave it
          undefined?
          Can we use document order or script order here?
          It's tempting to use the same order as we use for compositing but
          remember that not everything that is timed is composited (e.g.
          groups).

        which may have been defined declaratively rather than by using the API.

      <h2>Interaction with script</h2>
      <p>
        The Web Animations model may be modified using the API defined in this
        specification.
        This iteraction between script execution and the regular operation of
        the model is defined as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changes made to the timing model are reflected immediately in the
            values returned by timing model interfaces.
            <span
            class="todo">(Need to be more specific here. Once the section
            numbers have stabilized we could put section numbers here.)</span>
            Similarly, timing model methods that operate on the current state
            of the model such as pausing or reversing are applied to
            a fully-updated timing model, that is, after all previous
            modifications have been incorporated.
          </p>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              For example, if an <a>Animation</a>'s <code>startTime</code> is
              changed via the API, the value returned when querying the
              animation's <code>endTime</code> will reflect updated state of the
              timing model immediately.
            </p>
            <pre class="example sh_javascript">
              // Initially startTime is 3 and endTime is 5
              anim.startTime = 4;
              alert(anim.endTime); // Displays '6'
            </pre>
            <p>
              The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
              timing model such as adding and removing children from
              a <a>TimingGroup</a>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changes to the timing model other than <a
            href="#seeking-a-timed-item">seek operations</a> do not cause
            <a href="#timing-events">timing events</a> to be dispatched
            immediately.
            Instead, such events are dispatched upon the next sample as defined
            in <a href="#event-dispatch" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior of events with relation to seek operations is defined
            in <a href="#event-dispatch-during-seeking" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              For example, if a series of modifications to the timing model in
              a single script block causes a <a>TimedItem</a>'s <a>item time</a>
              to jump from being outside the active interval, to inside the
              interval, and then outside again no events are fired as in the
              following example.
            </p>
            <pre class="example sh_javascript">
              // document.timeline.currentTime is 3
              var anim = new Animation(null, null, 2);
              anim.onstart = function() { alert("started"); };
              anim.play(); // startTime = 3
              anim.startTime = Infinity;

            been performed at some time after the current script block completes
            execution.

          <p class="issue">
            I'm unsure if this is the desired behavior.
            Gecko, for example, forces a synchronous sample when a seek is
            performed.
            This certainly makes testing simpler but I'm not sure if this is
            a good idea or not.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Do we need to put some minimum requirement on when samples are
            performed?
            By the time the next script block executes can I assume the model is
            up to date?

            The value returned by

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>
      <p>
        The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
        The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
        resource on which they are specified.
        For resources with the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
        [[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a
        href="svg-integration.html">Web Animations and SVG Integration</a>
        specification.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
        their MIME type.
        As a result, temporal addressing may not be supported in all situations
        where Web Animations content is used.

      <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Discarding past animations</h3>
        <p>
          If implementations are required to preserve all state associated with
          animations then the resources required by an animation could continue
          to increase without limit over time. For long-running animations, and
          particularly those where animations are added dynamically, this could
          lead to degraded performance and eventual failure.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            I'm not sure how to define this. We could say all animations with
            <code><var>end time converted to document time</var> &lt;
            <var>current document time</var> - 5min</code> can be discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, but what about crazy documents that put 1 million
            animations in a 5min span? Just leave that up to the browser.
            Also, what about mobile clients, is 5 min too long? Is this too
            prescriptive?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe, just make some suggestions (e.g. 1 min for mobile clients,
            5 min for desktop?) and then define an exception to throw if there
            is a seek to some time outside that window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, note that defining this in terms of past intervals is
            direction-specific but that's probably ok since most long-running
            animations will run forwards.
