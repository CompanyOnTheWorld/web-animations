      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform.
        It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
        expose its features through declarative means.
        In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
        the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
        for scripting.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Use cases</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations model aims at three broad areas of application:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>User interface effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Animation can be used to give visual clues and feedback to make
              a user interface more readily comprehensible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a user action results in a table row being
              removed to represent an item being removed from a shopping cart.
              In such a case, fading the row to transparent and then shifting
              the subsequent rows up to fill the space over a few hundred
              milliseconds provides the user with clear feedback as to the
              results of their action as opposed to instantly removing the row
              from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this scenario not only are the animated effects of
              fading and shifting required, but so is synchronization, both
              between the animations, and between animations and scripted
              actions (removing the table row from the DOM after the animations
              have completed).
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Storytelling and visualisation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Another type of animation uses the animated effect to convey
              a story or represent some information.
              Unlike user interface effects which are largely a presentational
              adjunct to the content, these animations form an essential part of
              the content presented to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in an animated cartoon two cats fly through space
              to another planet leaving a rainbow trail behind them.
              After arriving at the planet a change of scene occurs and the user
              should decide whether or not the cats enter a magic mountain by
              selecting one of two preset destinations in the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              This scenario requires the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>animated effects for moving characters along a path as well as
                  warping a path (the rainbow trail),</li>
              <li>synchronization that allows some actions to happen
                  simultaneously (the two cats moving) and others in sequence
                  (the change of scene),</li>
              <li>play control to allow rewinding the cartoon, or changing its
                  playback rate to accommodate particular learning or
                  accessibility needs (particularly if audio or textual captions
                  are included as described in the next use case category),</li>
              <li>the ability to trigger alternate animations at different
                  points in the overall story.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Similar use cases in this category include visualising physical
              phenomena such as spring motion for educational purposes,
              or visualising data such as the prevalence of a disease over
              a geographical space over a year whereby animation is used to
              present the time-based component of the data.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Synchronizing media and animated effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Finally, animation is often used in conjunction with other media
              such as video and audio.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, the subtitles shown on a karaoke video may indicate
              the current position in the lyrics through a ball bouncing from
              one syllable to the next.
              In this scenario it is necessary to maintain strict
              synchronization between the audio and animation even in the face
              of user interaction such as rewinding or pausing the audio or
              network events such as a delay due to media buffering.
            </p>
            <p>
              A more complicated example of this category is applying a series
              of independent sound effects to an animated cartoon or adding
              a video as the background of an animated scene such that is cued
              to start mid-way into the scene.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The nature of these uses cases differs significantly and whilst Web
          Animations attempts to address each use case, technologies built on
          top of the Web Animations may expose features tailored towards more
          specific use cases rather catering to each scenario equally.
        </p>

        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a Web page.
          Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
          they are described in different terms.
          This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
          encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
          This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
          specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
          without any observable change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defining CSS Transitions, CSS Animations and SVG's animation features
          in terms of a common model opens up possibilities of synchronizing
          animations, interchanging their definitions, and manipulating them
          using a common programming interface regardless of their markup.
          To facilitate this process of redefining these features in terms of
          a common model, this specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding
          specification, which describes how CSS features can be implemented in
          terms of Web Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification
          which does the same for SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
          Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]].
          It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
          the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
          Animation can be removed.
          To this end, features not present in Web Animations that are part of
          SVG are described in full in the SVG and Web Animations integration
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programming interface component of this specification makes
          some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [[HTML5]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Overview of this specification</h3>
        <p>
          This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
          This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
          abstract model.
          The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
          and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

      <h2>Web Animations model overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
        independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
        model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces
        the values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100
            pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width
        for the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
        the animation model.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is independent
          of previous inputs, the model may be described as stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are a few apparent exceptions to the stateless behavior of the
          timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, events are fired when, for example, one sample falls
          on the opposite side of an animation's interval boundary to the
          previous sample.
          This is certainly stative behavior.
          However, events should be considered as a layer added on top of the
          core timing model.
          When no event listeners are registered, the model is stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other exception to this stateless behavior is that a number of
          methods defined in the <a href="#script-interface">programming
          interface</a> to the model provide play control such as pausing and
          reversing an item.
          These methods are defined in terms of the time at which they are
          called and are therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but, like events, are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the <a
          href="#script-interface">programming interface</a>, it has no
          influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not conflict with
          the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
          down a number of steps to each animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A hierarchy of timing nodes.
          Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.
          At the root of the tree is the global clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
          on, as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent
          cascade down to its descendants.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          animations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Timing model concepts</h2>
      <p>
        In Web Animations timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
        between timing nodes.
        Parent nodes provide timing information to their child nodes in the form
        of <a>time values</a>.
        A <dfn>time value</dfn> is a real number which nominally represents
        a number of seconds from some moment.
        The connection between <a>time values</a> and wall-clock seconds may be
        obscured by any number of transformations applied to the value as it
        passes through the time hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        In the future we may have timelines that are based on UI gestures in
        which case the connection between time values and seconds will be
        weakened even further.
      </p>

      <h2>The global clock</h2>
      <p>
        At the root of the Web Animations timing hierarchy is the <a>global
        clock</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>global clock</dfn> is a source of monotonically increasing
        <a>time values</a> unaffected by adjustments to the system clock.
        The <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global clock</a> represent
        wall-clock seconds from an unspecified historical moment.
        The absolute value of the <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global
        clock</a> are insignificant, only their rate of change.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that the <a>global clock</a> is not exposed in the <a
        href="#script-interface">programming interface</a> and nor is it
        expected to be exposed by markup.
        As a result the moment from which <a>global clock</a> <a>time values</a>
        are measured, that is, the zero time of the clock, is allowed to be
        implementation-dependent.
        One user agent may measure the number of seconds since the the user
        agent was loaded whilst another may use the time when the device was
        started.
        Both approaches are acceptable and produce no observable difference
        in the output of the model.

      <h2>Timelines</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>timeline</dfn> provides a source of <a>time values</a> for the
        purpose of synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, a <a>timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a> such
        that its absolute time is calculated as a fixed offset from the time of
        the <a>global clock</a>.
        This offset is established by designating some moment as the timeline's
        <dfn>zero time</dfn> and recording the <a>time value</a> of the
        <a>global clock</a> at that moment.
        At subsequent moments, the <a>time value</a> of the timeline is
        calculated as the difference between the current <a>time value</a> of
        the <a>global clock</a> and the value recorded at the <a>zero time</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        Note that we anticipate that other types of timelines may be introduced
        in the future that are not tied to the global clock.
        For example, a timeline whose time values correspond to UI gestures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a <a>timeline</a> may be defined to relative a moment that has yet
        to occur, it may not always be able to return a meaningful <a>time
        value</a>.
        A <a>timeline</a> is considered to be <dfn>not started</dfn> when it is
        in such a state that it cannot produce a <a>time value</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The document timeline</h3>
        <p>
          Each document has a <a>timeline</a> called the <dfn>document
          timeline</dfn> whose <a>time value</a> at a given moment is calculated
          as a fixed offset from the <a>global clock</a> such that its <a>zero
          time</a> corresponds to the moment immediately prior to dispatching
          the load event of the document.
          Prior to this moment, the <a>document timeline</a> is <a>not
          started</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For documents that support the concept of <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
          ">current document readiness</a>, this is the moment after the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
          ">current document readiness</a> has changed to "complete" but
          before dispatching the load event.
          For user agents that support Navigation Timing [[NAVIGATION-TIMING]],
          this occurs between the <em>domComplete</em> and
          <em>loadEventStart</em> timings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the <a>document timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a>
          by a fixed offset, <a>time values</a> reported by the <a>document
          timeline</a> increase monotonically.
          Furthermore, since no scaling is applied, these <a>time values</a>
          represent wall-clock seconds.

          The children of a <a>timeline</a> are called <em>players</em>.
          A player takes a <a>timed item</a> which is a static description of
          some timed behavior and binds it to a <a>timeline</a> so that it runs.
          A player also allows run-time control of the connection between the
          <a>timed item</a> and its <a>timeline</a> by providing pausing,
          seeking, and speed control.
          The relationship between a player and a <a>timed item</a> is analogous
          to that of a DVD player and a DVD.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A <dfn>player</dfn> connects a single <a>timed item</a>, called its
        <dfn>source content</dfn>, to a <a>timeline</a> and provides playback
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>player</a> records the <a>time value</a> of its <a>timeline</a>
        at which its <a>source content</a> is scheduled to begin

      <section>
        <h3>The current time of a player</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Players</a> also provide a <a>time value</a> to their <a>source
          content</a> called the player's <dfn>current time</dfn>.
          The calculation of the <a>current time</a> is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><a>current time</a> =
          (<var>timeline time</var> - <a title="player start time">start
          time</a>) * <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
          - <a>time drift</a></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time value</a> of the
          <a>timeline</a> with which this <a>player</a> is associated.</li>
          <li><var>start time</var> is the player's <a
          title="player start time">start time</a>.</li>
          <li><var>playback rate</var> is the <a
          title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> value described in <a
          href="#speed-control" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
          <li><var>time drift</var> is the <a>time drift</a> value described in
          <a href="#seeking-and-pausing" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the <a>timeline</a> with which is <a>player</a> is <a>not
          started</a> then the <a>current time</a> is <code>null</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often useful to treat the <a>current time</a> as zero when it
          would otherwise be <code>null</code>.
          Hence we define the <dfn>effective current time</dfn> as being equal
          to <a>current time</a> unless it is <code>null</code>, in which case
          the <var>effective current time</var> be zero.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure for performing manual updates to the <a>current time</a>

        <h3>Seeking and pausing</h3>
        <p>
          Seeking and pausing a player are closely related and are described
          here together.
        </p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to seeking</h4>
          <p>
            Changing the current playback position of a player can be used to
            rewind its <a>source content</a> to its start point, fast-forward
            to a point in the future, or to provide ad-hoc synchronization
            between timed items.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in Web Animations, the <a title="player start time">start
            time</a> of a <a>player</a> has special significance in determining
            the priority of animations (see <a href="#combining-animations"
            class="sectionRef"></a>) and so we cannot simply adjust the <a
            title="player start time">start time</a>.
            Instead, an additional offset is introduced called the <a>time
            drift</a> that further offsets a player's <a>current time</a> from
            its timeline.
            The effect of the <a>time drift</a> when seeking is illustrated
            below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/seeking.svg" width="600">
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            At time <var>t</var>, a seek is performed on the player changing its
            <a>current time</a> from 1.5s to 2s.<br>
            As a result, the <a>time drift</a> is set to -0.5s.<br>
            Note that the <a title="player start time">start time</a> indicated
            by a red star does not change.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible to seek a player even if its <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            Once the timeline begins, the player will being playback from the
            seeked time.

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to pausing</h4>
          <p>
            Pausing can be used to temporarily suspend a <a>player</a>.
            Like seeking, pausing effectively causes the <a>current time</a> of
            a player to be offset from its <a>timeline</a> by means of
            setting the <a>time drift</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pausing before a player's <a title="player start time">start
            time</a> will cause the player's <a>source content</a> to begin in
            a paused state but does not delay its start as is illustrated below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">

            The effect of pausing a player at different moments.<br>
            In case A, the player is paused and unpaused before its <a>start
            time</a>.
            The pause has no effect.<br><br>
            In case B, the player is paused before the
            <a title="player start time">start time</a> and remains paused.
            At the scheduled <a title="player start time">start time</a> the
            <a>source content</a> begins playing in a paused state.
            When the player is unpaused it continues playing.
            The resulting player has a <a>time drift</a> equivalent to the
            interval from the <a title="player start time">start time</a> to
            when it was unpaused.<br><br>
            In case C, the player is paused and unpaused during the <a>active
            interval</a> of the source content.
            After unpausing, the player has a <a>time drift</a> equivalent to
            the duration of the pause interval.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            I suspect we don't want this behavior now that player is a separate

          <h4>Seeking and pausing properties</h4>
          <p>
            <a>Players</a> track three properties related to seeking and
            pausing.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>time drift</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The offset from a player's scheduled current time as defined by
              its <a title="player start time">start time</a>, and its actual
              current time after accounting for the effects of seeking and
              pausing.
              The <a>time drift</a> is initially zero and is updated as per the
              definition in <a href="#calculating-the-time-drift"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>paused state</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              A boolean value that is true if the player is currently paused.
              The <a>paused state</a> is initially false.

            <dt><dfn>pause start time</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The player's <a>effective current time</a> at the time when the
              <a>paused state</a> was last newly true.
              The <a>pause start time</a> is initially zero.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            A number of calculations for performing seeking and pausing are
            defined to operate even when the associated <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            For such situations we define the <dfn>effective timeline time</dfn>
            as the current <a>time value</a> of the <a>timeline</a> associated
            with a <a>player</a>;
            if the timeline is <a>not started</a>, then the <var>effective
            timeline time</var> is zero.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Calculating the <a>time drift</a></h4>
          <p>
            The <a>time drift</a> value is both a stored and a calculated value.
            When a player is paused, the value is calculated from the <a>pause
            start time</a>.
            When a player is not paused, the stored value is used.
            The stored value is initially zero, and is updated when the player
            is unpaused or seeked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since pausing does not take effect prior to when a player's source
            content begins, we first define the beginning of a player's source
            content for the purposes of pausing as a player's <em>earliest
            moment</em>.
            The calculation is as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <dfn>earliest moment</dfn> = <code>min(0, <var>start delay of
            source content</var>)</code>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="issue">
            I'm pretty sure we don't want this behavior now that the player is
            separate to the source content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this definition we can define the value of <a>time drift</a>
            at a given moment as follows:
          </p>
          <dl class="switch">
            <dt>If the <a>paused state</a> is true,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the result of 
              <code>(<a>effective timeline time</a> - <a
              title="player start time">start time</a>) * <a
              title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> -
              max(<a>pause start time</a>, <a>earliest moment</a>)</code>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the stored value for this property.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Updating the <a>paused state</a></h4>
          <p>
            The procedure for updating the <a>paused state</a> is as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Let <var>new value</var> be the new paused state to set.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>new value</var> equals the current <a>paused state</a>,
              return.
            </li>
            <li>
              The next step depends on the current <a>paused state</a> as
              follows,
              <dl class="switch">
                <dt>If <a>paused state</a> is true,</dt>
                <dd>
                  Set the <em>stored</em> value of <a>time drift</a> to the
                  <em>current calculated</em> value of <a>time drift</a> as
                  defined in <a href="#calculating-the-time-drift"
                  class="sectionRef"></a>.
                </dd>
                <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
                <dd>
                  Record the current value of the <a>effective current time</a>
                  as <a>pause start time</a>.

          <h4>Performing a seek</h4>
          <p>
            <dfn>Seeking</dfn> is the process of updating a player's <a>current
            time</a> to a desired value.
            It is achieved using the following procedure:

            <li>The steps for adjusting the <a>current time</a> depend on the

            The rate of play of a player can be controlled by setting its
            <em>playback rate</em>.
            For example, setting a playback rate of 2 will cause the player's
            <a>current time</a> to increase at twice the rate of its
            <a>timeline</a>.
            Similarly, a playback rate of -1 will cause the player's <a>current
            time</a> to decrease at the same rate as the <a>time values</a> from
            its <a>timeline</a> increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that <a>timed items</a> also have a <a
            title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> associated with
            them that behaves differently to that defined here.
          </p>

        <p>
          <a>Players</a> have a <dfn title="player playback
          rate">playback rate</dfn> that provides a scaling factor from the rate
          of change of the associated <a>timeline</a>'s <a>time values</a> to
          the player's <a>current time</a>.
          The <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> is initially 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting a player's <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
          to zero effectively pauses the player but without affecting the

            rate.

      <h2>Timed items</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, if set, is a type of
        <dfn>timed item</dfn>.
        There are three types of <a>timed item</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a>animations</a>,</li>
        <li><a>timing groups</a>, and</li>
        <li><a>media references</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> can be associated with at most
        one <a>player</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>Timed items</a> can be chained together into a hierarchy using
        <a>timings groups</a> in which case a <a>timed item</a> may be <dfn
        title="indirectly associated with a player">indirectly associated</dfn>
        with a <a>player</a> via an ancestor <a>timing group</a>.
        Only the root <a>timed item</a> of such a hierarchy can be <dfn
        title="directly associated with a player">directly associated</dfn> with
        a <a>player</a>.
        Attempting to associate a <a>timed item</a> that has a <a>parent timing
        group</a> with a <a>player</a> results in the <a>timed item</a> being
        removed from the <a>parent timing group</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>timed item</a> is considered to be <dfn>associated with
        a player</dfn> it is <a
        title="directly associated with a player">directly</a> or <a
        title="indirectly associated with a player">indirectly</a> associated.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>timed item</a>, <var>item</var>, is <dfn>associated with
        a timeline</dfn>, <var>timeline</var>, if <var>item</var> is
        <a>associated with a player</a> which, in turn, is associated with
        <var>timeline</var>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All types of <a>timed item</a> define a number of common properties.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The active interval</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The period that a <a>timed item</a> is scheduled to run is called
            the <a>active interval</a>.
            Each <a>timed item</a> has only one such interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is determined by the
            <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> of the <a>timed
            item</a> but may be shifted by a <a>start delay</a> on the <a>timed
            item</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>active
            duration</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The relationship between the <a title="timed item start time">start
            time</a>, <a>start delay</a>, and <a>active duration</a> is
            illustrated below.

            Examples of the effect of the <a>start delay</a> on the endpoints of
            the <a>active interval</a>.<br>
            (a) A timed item with no delay; the <a
            title="timed item start time">start time</a> and beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> are coincident.<br>
            (b) A timed item with a positive delay; the beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> is deferred by the delay.<br>
            (c) A timed item with a negative delay; the beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> is brought forward by the delay.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <a>Timed items</a> define an <dfn>active interval</dfn> which is the
          period of time during which the item is scheduled to produce its
          effect (with the exception of <a>fill modes</a> which apply outside
          the <a>active interval</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is defined by the
          combination of the timed item's <a title="timed item start time">start
          time</a> and <a>start delay</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a>'s <dfn title="timed item start time">start
          time</dfn> is the moment at which the <a>parent timing group</a>, if
          any, has scheduled the <a>timed item</a> to begin.
          It is expressed in <a>inherited time</a>.
          In most cases, including the case when the <a>timed item</a> has no
          <a>parent timing group</a>, the <a title="timed item start time">start
          time</a> is zero.
          The singular exception is <a>sequence timing groups</a> which set the
          <a title="timed item start time">start times</a> of their children as
          described in <a
          href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-a-sequence-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>,
          a <a>timed item</a> also has a <dfn>start delay</dfn> which is an
          offset from the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>.
          Unlike the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> which is
          determined by the <a>parent timing group</a>, the <a>start delay</a>
          is a property of the <a>timed item</a> itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval<a> of a <a>timed item</a>,
          expressed in <a title="inherited time">inherited time space</a>, is
          the sum of the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> and the
          <a>start delay</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These definitions are incorporated in the calculation of the <a>local
          time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a>) and <a>active time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of the <a>active interval</a> is called the <dfn>active
          duration</dfn>, the calculation of which is defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-active-duration" class="sectionRef"></a>.

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
            These different points of reference produce different <em>time
            spaces</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
            graphics.
            The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
            a coordinate space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as with coordinate spaces, time spaces can also be nested.
            <a>Timing groups</a> typically perform some
            transformations on the <a>time values</a> they
            receive from their <a title="parent timing group">parent</a> or
            <a>player</a> before passing on the transformed <a>time values</a>
            to their children.
            Child <a>timed items</a> then operate <em>within</em> that
            transformed time space.

          <p>
            Children take the transformed time values from their
            parent&mdash;called the <a>inherited time</a>&mdash; and add their
            <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> to establish their
            own <a title="local time">local time space</a> as illustrated below.

            At given moment, a <a>timed item</a> may be described as being in

            These states are only established for the duration of a single

            of the model such as event dispatch.

            The different states are illustrated below.

            An example of the different states used for describing a <a>timed

            Note that a <a>timed item</a> is considered to be <a>in effect</a>
            for all times inside the <a>active interval</a> as well as times
            outside the <a>active interval</a> where a <a>fill mode</a> is
            applied.
          </p>
          <p>
            These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
            follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a>scheduled</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls before the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
              This state is only used in conjunction with the
              <a><em>active</em></a> state to define the <a><em>current</em></a>
              state.
            </dd>

              <a>active interval</a>.
              Transitions to and from the <a><em>active</em></a> state trigger
              timing events as defined in <a href="#timing-events"

                <a>local time</a> of an ancestor <a>timing group</a> falls
                before or inside its <a>active interval</a> thereby opening up
                the possibility that this <a>timed item</a> might play again
                (e.g. due to repeating).
              </p>
              <p>
                This state is used in the <a

                all <a>animations</a> and <a>players</a> that are likely to be

              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the <a>current</a> state provides an important
                definition for managing the amount of memory required by
                implementations.
                Assuming a monotonically increasing <a>timeline</a>, in the
                absence of dynamic changes to the model, an implementation can
                safely discard all <a>timed items</a> that are <em>not</em>
                <a>current</a> and not referenced elsewhere provided they take
                care to preserve any <a>fill values</a> since they will not have
                any dynamic effect.
              </p>
            </dd>

            <dd>

              item's <a>active interval</a> or outside the interval but at
              a time where the item's <a>fill mode</a> (see <a
              href="#fill-behavior" class="sectionRef"></a>) causes it to affect
              its target.
              <a>Timed items</a> only produce a <a>transformed time</a> when the

              At all other times, the <a>transformed time</a> of a <a>timed

      <h2>Fill behavior</h2>
      <p>
        The effect of a <a>timed item</a> outside its <a>active interval</a> is

        The normative definition of these modes is incorporated in the

      <h2>Repeating</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Iteration intervals</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that a timed item should repeat
          a fixed number of times or indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, a timed item can have multiple
          <a>iteration intervals</a> although typically only the interval
          corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <dfn>iteration
          duration</dfn>.
          The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of a timed item is simply its
          <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of a timed item is zero,
          however some specific types of timed item such as timing groups
          override this behavior and provide an alternative intrinsic duration
          (see <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-parallel-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-sequence-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>iteration duration</a> of a <a>timed item</a> may be set by the
          author to represent a value other than the <a>intrinsic iteration
          duration</a>.

        <h3>Controlling iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The number of times a <a>timed item</a> repeats is called its
          <dfn>iteration count</dfn>.
          The <a>iteration count</a> is a real number greater than or equal to
          zero.
          The <a>iteration count</a> may also be positive infinity to represent
          that the <a>timed item</a> repeats indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a>iteration count</a>, <a>timed items</a> also
          have an <dfn>iteration start</dfn> property which specifies an offset
          into the series of iterations at which the <a>timed item</a> should
          begin.
          The <a>iteration start</a> is a finite real number greater than or
          equal to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior of these parameters is defined in the calculations in <a
          href="#core-timed-item-calculations" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The effect of the <a>iteration count</a> and <a>iteration start</a>

            parameters.<br>
            In the first case the <a>iteration count</a> is 2.5 resulting in the
            third iteration being cut-off half way through its <a>iteration
            interval</a>.<br>
            The second case is the same but with an <a>iteration start</a> of
            0.5.
            This causes the <a>timed item</a> to begin half way through the
            first iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the <a>iteration count</a> parameter, the <a>iteration
            start</a> parameter does not effect the length of the <a>active
            duration</a>.

          <p>
            Note that values of <a>iteration start</a> greater than or equal to
            one are generally not useful unless used in combination with an

        <h3>Iteration time space</h3>
        <p>
          We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
          <a>local time and inherited time</a> (see <a
          href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Iteration time space</em> is a time space whose zero time is the
          beginning of a timed item's current iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <a>active
          time</a> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
          interval.
          This time space, however, is internal to the model and not exposed in
          the script interface or in markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          These time spaces are illustrated below.

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
          Animations defines <a>active time</a> and <a>iteration
          time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <em>active time space</em>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>active time</a> defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-active-time" class="sectionRef"></a> will
          never return a negative value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
          <em>document time space</em> which is time space of the <a>time
          values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> of the <a

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          When a timed item repeats we must define the behavior at the iteration
          boundaries.
          For this and indeed for all interval-timing, Web Animations uses an
          endpoint-exclusive timing model.
          This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
          In interval notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>.
          This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
          sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated item, at local time 1s,
          the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced items, at inherited time 1s, only item B will be
          <a>active</a>; there is no overlap.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a

      <p>
        Like <a>players</a>, <a>timed items</a> also have a <dfn
        title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</dfn> parameter.
        The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of a <a>timed
        item</a> is a finite real number that acts as a multiplier when
        calculating the <a>timed item</a>'s <a>transformed time</a> from its
        <a>local time</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback
        rate</a> of a <a>timed item</a> differs from the setting the <a
        title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on a player.
        Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in <a
        href="#core-timed-item-calculations" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In summary, the behavior of the <a title="timed item playback

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> is applied

            the time while it is <a title="start delay">delayed</a> or <a
            title="fill mode">filling</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting a negative <a title="timed item playback rate">playback
            rate</a> on a <a>timed item</a> causes the <a>timed item</a> to
            begin at the end of its <a>active interval</a>.
            This differs from the <a title="player playback rate">playback
            rate</a> on a <a>player</a>.
            Setting a <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on
            a <a>player</a> to a negative value at a moment before the
            <a>player</a>'s </a>source content</a> has begun, will result in the

          <li>
            Setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of
            a <a>timed item</a> affects the calculated value of the <a>active

              of a <a>timed item</a> whose <a>local time</a> is within its
              <a>active interval</a> will cause it to jump.
              This is because the <a>active duration</a> will be updated but the
              <a>local time</a> will not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, if other <a>timed items</a> depend on the <a>timed

              items</a> in a <a>sequence timing group</a>, they too may jump as
              a result of setting the <a>timed item</a>'s <a

            </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
          takes an <a>inherited time</a> value and converts it to an
          <a>iteration time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this further transformations are applied before resulting at
          a final <a>transformed time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in this process is to calculate the boundary when the
          <a>timed item</a> is <a>active</a>, that is, the <a>active
          duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is illustrated below.

          Calculation of the <a>active duration</a> is based on
          multiplying the <a>iteration duration</a> by the <a>iteration

          (4) The <a>scaled active time</a> is then converted to an offset
          within a single iteration: the <a>iteration time</a>.<br>
          (5) The <a>iteration time</a> is converted into a <a>directed time</a>

        <h3>Scaling the time</h3>
        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which a <a>timed item</a>
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the <a>timed item</a> to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides a variety of <a>timing
          functions</a> that scale the progress of a <a>timed item</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Timing functions</a> take an input time fraction and produce

          <p>
            A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
            curve to scale the time.
            The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0,0) and (1,1) while two
            control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of
            the curve.
            Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
            lie within the range [0,1] such a curve produces a function that is
            used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
            (the <var>y</var> values).
            This arrangement is illustrated below.

        <p>
          While it is possible to set the timing properties of <a>timed
          items</a> individually, it is often useful to synchronize <a>timed
          items</a> so that they share common timing properties and maintain
          their temporal relationship.  This is achieved using a <a>timing
          group</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple example is illustrated below.

        <p>
          When a <a>timing group</a> is directly associated with

      <p>
        A <dfn>timing group</dfn> is a type of <a>timed item</a> that contains
        an ordered sequence of zero or more <a>timed items</a> known as <dfn
        title="child timed item">child timed items</dfn>.
        At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> may be a <a>child timed item</a>
        of at most one <a>timing group</a> known as the <dfn>parent timing
        group</dfn>.
        Furthermore, the <a>parent timing group</a> cannot be the same <a>timed
        item</a> as the <a>child timed item</a> itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temporal relationship between a <a>child timed item</a> and its
        <a>parent timing group</a> is incorporated in the definition of
        <a>inherited time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"

      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of a <a>timing group</a> is based on the
          timing of the group.
          Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <a>transformed time</a>.
          With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
          <em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <a>timing group</a> has an <a>iteration count</a> of
          2, then the children of of the group will all play twice since they
          effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an <a>timing group</a> base their timing on the
          group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
          children play again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that even in this case, the child <a>timed items</a> still have
          only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
          However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
          interval</a> is played twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
          as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
          count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
          of the children.

          Specifying an <a>iteration count</a> of 2 on an <a>timing group</a>

          that child playing 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further result of the children of a <a>timing group</a> basing their
          timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they cannot
          animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
          This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
          change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
          This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.

          In the first instance, a <a>timed item</a> has a negative delay and an

          However, when a similar <a>timed item</a> is placed inside a <a>timing
          group</a> with a specified <a>iteration duration</a> it has the effect
          of clipping the child <a>timed item</a>'s <a>active interval</a>.

        <p>
          Some further consequences of <a>timing group</a> children basing their

          <li>
            Changing the <a>playback direction</a> of a <a>timing group</a> will

          that schedules its <a>child timed items</a> such that they play in
          turn following their order in the group.
          This ordering is achieved by adjusting the <a

      <h2>Overview of the animation model</h2>

        The Web Animations <em>animation model</em> takes the <a>time

        <em>timing model</em> for a given <a>animation</a> and applies it as the
        input to the <a>animation</a>'s <a>animation effect</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The output of each <a>animation effect</a> is then combined with other
        <a>animation effects</a> using an <a>animation stack</a> before being
        applied to the target properties (see <a href="#combining-animations"

      <h2>Animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        An <dfn>animation effect</dfn> takes a <a>time fraction</a> and
        a <a>current iteration</a> value and uses them to calculate an
        <a>animation value</a> for its <a>target property</a>.
        Each <a>animation</a> may have at most one <a>animation effect</a>
        associated with it.

        We will probably lift this restriction and allow animations to have
        multiple effects.

      <p>
        Since the result of an <a>animation effect</a> is based on the
        <a>time fraction</a> and <a>current iteration</a> value, it is updated

          <em>effect value</em> emphasises that this is the output of a single
          <a>animation effect</a> before compositing.

      <h2>Key frame animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>key frame animation effect</dfn> is an <a>animation effect</a>
        that produces <a>animation values</a> for a property by interpolating
        between a series of property values positioned at fractional offsets in
        the range [0,1].
      </p>
      <p>
        Each pair of a property value and a corresponding offset is called
        a <dfn>key frame</dfn>.
        A <a>key frame</a> may also provide an optional <a>timing function</a>
        which scales the <a>timing fraction</a> values between the <a>key
        frame</a> and the next <a>key frame</a> in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, due to a <a>timing function</a> specified on either the <a>timed
        item</a> from which the <a>time fraction</a> is derived or on an
        individual <a>key frame</a>, the scaled <a>time fraction</a> lies
        outside the range [0,1], the specified <a>key frame</a> property values
        are extrapolated to cover the extended range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The behavior when <a>key frames</a> overlap or have unsupported values
        is defined in the following section, <a
        href="#the-iteration-value-of-a-key-frame-animation-effect"

        <h3>The iteration value of a key frame animation effect</h3>
        <p>
          The <a>iteration value</a> of a <a>key frame animation effect</a> for
          a given <a>time fraction</a> is calculated as follows.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the target property of the effect is not <a>animatable</a>
              abort the procedure since the effect cannot be applied.</li>
          <li>Let <var>key frames</var> be the list of <a>key frames</a>
              specified on the effect.</li>
          <li>Let <var>time fraction</var> be the <a>time fraction</a> for which
              the <a>iteration value</a> is to be calculated.</li>
          <li>Let <var>underlying value</var> be the current <a>underlying
              value</a> provided by the <a>compositor</a>.
          <li>Sort <var>key frames</var> using a <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability">stable
              sort</a> such that the <a>key frame</a> offsets are in ascending
              order.</li>
          <li>Remove any <a>key

          <li>Remove any <a>key frames</a> from <var>key
              frames</var> whose property value is invalid or unsupported.</li>
          <li>If <var>key frames</var> is an empty list, return <var>underlying
              value</var>.</li>
          <li>If there is no <a>key frame</a> with offset of 0, create a new key
              frame with an offset 0, a property value set to <var>underlying
              value</var>, and no <a>timing function</a> and add it to the
              beginning of <var>key frames</var>.

                This behavior is currently under discussion.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Similarly, if there is no <a>key frame</a> with offset of 1,
              create a new key frame with an offset 1, a property value set to
              <var>underlying value</var>, and no <a>timing function</a> and
              append it to the end of <var>key frames</var>.</li>
          <li>If <var>time fraction</var> is less zero and there is more than
              one <a>key frame</a> in <var>key frames</var> with offset 0,
              return the property value of the first <a>key frame</a> in
              <var>key frames</var>.</li>
          <li>If <var>time fraction</var> is greater than or equal to 1 and
              there is more than one <a>key frame</a> in <var>key frames</var>
              with offset of 1, return the property value of the last <a>key
              frame</a> in <var>key frames</var>.</li>
          <li>Let <var>start key frame</var> be the last <a>key frame</a> in
              <var>key frames</var> whose offset is less than or equal to
              <var>time fraction</var> and less than 1.
              If there is no such <a>key frame</a> (because, for example,
              the <a>time fraction</a> is negative), let <var>start key
              frame</var> be the last <a>key frame</a> whose offset is 0.</li>
          <li>Let <var>end key frame</var> be the next <a>key frame</a> in
              <var>key frames</var> after <var>start key frame</var>.</li>
          <li>If the pair of property values specified by <var>start key

              differ in <a>property type</a> or have the same <a>property

              then return the property value of <var>start key frame</var>

          <li>Let <var>start offset</var> be the offset of <var>start key

                  as the input to the funcion.

        <p>
          After calculating the <a>animation value</a> for an <a>animation

          property</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it is possible for multiple <a>in effect</a> <a

          often necessary to combine the results of several <a>animation
          effects</a> together.
          This process is called <em>compositing</em> and is based on
          establishing an <a>animation stack</a> for each property targetted by
          an <a>in effect</a> <a>animation effect</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After compositing the results of <a>animation

        <h3>Calculating the result of an animation stack</h3>
        <p>
          In order to calculate the final value of an <a>animation stack</a>
          the <a>animation values</a> of each
          <a>animation effect</a> in the stack are combined in order of priority
          from lowest to highest priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each step in the process of evaluating an <a>animation stack</a> takes
          an <dfn>underlying value</dfn> as input.
          The initial <a>underlying value</a> is the <a>base value</a> of the
          target property as defined in <a
          href="#combining-with-other-styles--the-override-stylesheet"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each <a>animation effect</a> in the stack, the <a>animation
          value</a> of the <a>animation effect</a> is combined with the
          <a>underlying value</a> and produces a new value.
          This resulting value becomes the <a>underlying value</a> for combining
          the next <a>animation effect</a> in the stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final value of an <a>animation stack</a>, called the
          <dfn>composited value</dfn>, is simply the result of combining the
          <a>animation value</a> of the final (highest priority) <a>animation
          effect</a> in the stack with the <a>underlying value</a>.

          The specific operation used to combine an <a>animation effect</a>'s

          by the <a>animation effect</a>'s <dfn>composition operation</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The possible <a>composition
          operations</a> and their meanings are as follows:

          <dd>
            The result of compositing the <a>animation value</a> with the

        <h3>Combining with other styles: the override stylesheet</h3>
        <p>
          Applying a <a>composited value</a> to a <a>target property</a> depends
          on establishing an <a>override stylesheet</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>override stylesheet</dfn> contains
          <a title="composited value">composited animation values</a>
          and acts with a higher priority than all other stylesheets.
          However, <code>!important</code> rules from all other stylesheets act
          with a higher priority than the <a>override stylesheet</a>.
          The <a>override stylesheet</a> is regenerated each time the
          <a>animation model</a> is updated (see <a href="#animation-effects"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a property is applied
          using the following process.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the <dfn>base value</dfn> of the property as

              value</a> [[!CSS21]] for that property in the absence of the
              <a>override stylesheet</a>.</li>
          <li>Establish the <a>animation stack</a> for the property (see <a
              href="#the-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
          <li>Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>animation
              stack</a> passing in the <a>base value</a> of the property as the
              initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
              href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-animation-stack"
              class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>

      <h3>Custom effects</h3>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In some situations the <a>animation
          effects</a> provided by Web Animations may be insufficient.
          For example, the <a>animation effects</a>
          defined here are only able to target certain CSS properties and DOM
          attributes.
          They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
          property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
          affecting the document content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases where the provided <a>animation
          effects</a> do not provide needed functionality, an effect defined by
          script may be used.
          Such <a>custom effects</a> receive a <a>time
          fraction</a> from the timing model and are responsible for producing
          the desired effect corresponding to the specified time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using an effect defined in script it is possible to animate not only
          otherwise un-animatable attributes and properties, but potentially
          anything that is accessible via script, including even producing audio
          or creating vibrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, using a <a>custom effect</a> that draws to a <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
          element it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
          featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
          SVG.
          Compared to using the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
          interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
          independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
          accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
          in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
          additional programming.
        </p>
      </div> <!-- informative -->
      <p>
        A <dfn>custom effect</dfn> is an author-defined programming callback

        <h4>Execution order of custom effects</h4>
        <p>
          Since <a>custom effects</a>, unlike <a
          title="animation effect">animation effects</a>, are not limited to
          a single <a>target property</a> and the steps for assessing their
          order of execution differs from <a>animation
          effects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Custom effects</a> are executed after all
          <a>animation effects</a> have completed and
          applied their result to their targets (see <a
          href="#combining-with-other-styles--the-override-stylesheet"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Need to define this more precisely.
          Are styles flushed?
          Presumably they are.
          Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
          animation effects and just do it once afterwards?
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the set of <a>custom effects</a>, the
          order of execution is initially the same as that defined for <a
          title="animation effect">animation effects</a> in <a
          href="#the-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          However, <a>custom effects</a> may also override
          this ordering through a <dfn
          title="custom effect priority">priority</dfn> property associated with
          the effect.
          This <a title="custom effect priority">priority</a> property, if
          defined, specifies the order in which the callbacks are executed
          such that the callback of the <a>custom effect</a> with the least
          priority is executed first.
        </p>
        <p>
          In deciding which of two <a>custom effects</a>,
          <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, should be executed first, the following
          rules are applied.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> based on their
              <a title="custom effect priority">priority</a> properties such
              that lower priorities are sorted first.
              If either does not have a defined <a
              title="custom effect priority">priority</a>, then treat the <a
              title="custom effect priority">priority</a> as being zero for the
              purposes of sorting.</li>
          <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same <a
              title="custom effect priority">priority</a>,
              sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> using the procedure defined for
              sorting <a>animation effects</a> in <a

      <h2>Timing events</h2>
      <p>
        As <a>timed items</a> play they report changes to
        their status through <dfn title="timing event">timing events</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>Timing events</a> are a property of the Web
        Animations timing model.
        As a result they are dispatched even for <a
        title="animation">animations</a> that do not have an associated
        <a>animation effect</a>, for <a>animations</a> whose
        <a>target element</a> is not rendered because it or a parent element has
        <span class="property">'display'</a> property of <a
        class="prop-value">'none'</a>, and for <a>timed
        items</a> that perform no animation such as <a>timing groups</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="annotation">
        <p><strong>Relationship to CSS and SVG events</strong></p>
        <p>
          CSS defines <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s and SVG defines <code>TimeEvent</code>s.
          The proposal here is to dispatch <a>TimingEvent</a>s in parallel to
          these events.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key difference is that the target of a <a>TimingEvent</a> is a
          <a>TimedItem</a> and not content.
          This model leaves firing of events at content up to the declarative
          mapping onto the model (e.g. CSS or SVG).
          This approach makes the Web Animations model more self-contained
          whilst permitting different mappings for different markup.
          For example, CSS fires events at the target element whilst SVG fires
          events at the element that generated the animation.

          They are only fired at <a>timed items</a>, never
          DOM nodes, so they won't clash with other events.

            Other potential event types for a later version:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>timingpause</em> &mdash;
              fired whenever <code>paused</code> is newly true on the associated
              <a>player</a>.
              <p>
                Use case: show a graphic overlay to mark a cartoon as
                paused.<br> Likewise <em>unpause</em>.

            </li>

              fired whenever <code>currentTime</code> is set on the
              <a>player</a> associated with a <a>timed item</a>.
              <p>
                Use case: If you are implementing something like SVG's syncbase
                timing with script you often need to do some bookkeeping on
                a seek.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>timingdirectionchange</em> &mdash;
              fired whenever the effective direction of the item changes (due to
              the direction attribute, changes to playbackRate, calling reverse
              etc. on either the item or an ancestor)
              <p>
                Use case: update UI to represent rewinding;
                stop audio when playing backwards.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>timingnewanimation</em> &mdash;
              fired whenever a new <a>Animation</a> object is created.
              <p>
                Use case: a timeline debugger. You want to show all animations
                that are playing or yet-to-play.
                Using this event (and
                <code>document.timeline.getCurrentAnimations</code>) you could
                build up a timegraph.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think this sort of event and this sort of use case would fit
                the MutationObserver pattern well.
                We could introduce a whole class of mutation records targetted
                at debugging (e.g. <em>timereschedule</em>)
              </p>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, although this is a bit different to a regular event (since
            it's qualified by a parameter), it seems like it might be nice to be
            able to do something like:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
            anim.onprogress(0.8,
             function() {
              // Issue a request to prefetch the next episode
             });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It would be called whenever you got a sample where
            <code>(<a>active time</a> / <a>active duration</a>)</code> &ge;
            <var>progress</var> was newly true.

        <h3>Uneased timing</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            <a>Timing events</a> in Web Animations rely on
            a mode of operating the timing model that does not apply <a
            title="timing function">timing functions</a> called <em>uneased
            timing</em>.
            There are two reasons for this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a>Timing functions</a> are not always
                invertible.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to dispatch events in the correct order it is often
                necessary to convert from a <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local
                time</a> to a common time space for sorting and non-invertible
                <a>timing functions</a> make this
                impractical.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a>Timing functions</a> on parent <a
                title="timing group">timing groups</a> can cause unnecessary
                events to be generated.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, consider a <a>timing group</a> that has a <a>timing
                function</a> that is not monotonically increasing such as
                a bounce effect.
                Within a single iteration of the <a>timing group</a> child <a
                title="timed item">timed items</a> may repeatedly exit and enter
                their <a>active interval</a>.
                Dispatching a <a>timing event</a> on each such moment is
                unlikely to be useful to most applications.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An analogue is a graphics editing program where the user can apply
            a blur filter to a geometric shape.
            The graphics program may draw a selection box around the bounding
            box of the geometric shape ignoring the fact that the blur stretches
            (infinitely) beyond the selection box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, since <a>fill modes</a> affect the
            calculation of times in ways that obscure the boundaries of the
            <a>active interval</a> they are also ignored when operating in
            <em>uneased time</em>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The <dfn>uneased timing</dfn> of a <a>timed item</a> refers to
          performing any of the calculations defined for the <a>timed item</a>
          with the following exceptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>Timing functions</a> on the <a>timed
              item</a> and all ancestor <a>timing
              groups</a> are ignored.</li>
          <li>The <a>fill modes</a> of the <a>timed item</a>
              and all ancestor <a>timing groups</a> are
              treated as <span class="prop-value">none</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the <em>uneased inherited time</em> of a <a>timed
          item</a> is calculated using the regular definition of <a>inherited
          time</a> after applying the two modifications to the timing of the
          item and its ancestors noted above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally the time value used as input to a child <a>timed item</a>
          of a <a>timing group</a> is the group's <a>transformed time</a>.
          However, since <a>uneased timing</a> does not apply <a
          title="timing function">timing functions</a>, we refer to <dfn>uneased
          child time</dfn> which is equivalent to both <em>uneased transformed
          time</em> and <em>uneased directed time</em>.

      <section>
        <h3>Inverse timing calculations</h3>
        <p>
          For times calculated using <a>uneased timing</a> it is possible to
          perform the reverse operation to, for example, convert times from
          a <a>child timed item</a> to that of its its <a>parent timing
          group</a> or <a>timeline</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calculating the <dfn><em>uneased local time</em> from <a>uneased child
          time</a></dfn> of a given <a>timed item</a> requires recording the
          iteration index that corresponds to the <a>uneased child time</a> and
          is calculated as follows.
        </p>
        <ol>

        <h3>Event parameters</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Timing events</a> have an associated <a>event

          the <a>timed item</a> that generated event at the moment the event is
          scheduled to occur.
          This time is constrained by the timing of the <a>parent timing
          group</a>'s <a>iteration interval</a> such that when converted to an
          <em>uneased iteration time</em> in the parent's <a

          The <dfn>event iteration index</dfn> is the value of the <a>timed

          group</a>.
          The last <a>timed item</a> in the chain at the opposite end to

        <h3>Event dispatch</h3>
        <p>
          <dfn>Events are queued</dfn> when either of the following occurs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a <a>timeline</a> is <a title="sampling">sampled</a>, or</li>
          <li>a <a>player</a> is <a title="seeking">seeked</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the former case&mdash;when a <a>timeline</a> is <a
          title="sampling">sampled</a>&mdash;since Web Animations put no
          requirements on the time between successive samples, it is often the
          case  that the moment when a change in state that should produce an
          event is scheduled to occur does not line up with a sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, except for the specific circumstances mentioned in following
          sections, the events that should be queued when <a>sampling</a>
          a <a>timeline</a> includes all events scheduled to occur in the
          interval since the previous sample time up to and including the
          current timeline time.

        <p class="note">
          Note that when a <a>player</a> is first <a

          href="#event-dispatch-and-time-adjustments" class="sectionRef"></a>
          after which point the previous sample time for that <a>player</a>
          will be resolved.
          As a result, there is never an occasion where the previous sample time
          is used and yet is undefined.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the latter case&mdash;when a <a>player</a> is <a

          <h4>Seeked event dispatch</h4>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              Under some circumstances the usual behavior of dispatching all
              events scheduled between two times is not appropriate either
              because it would produce such a large number of events that
              performance may be adversely affected,
              or because it would produce counter-intuitive results in the
              circumstances.
              In such situations, an alternative form of event dispatch called
              <a>seeked event dispatch</a> is used.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            <dfn>Seeked event dispatch</dfn> is a mode of event dispatch that
            produces at most one <a>timing event</a> per <a>timed item</a> by
            comparing whether the <a>timed item</a> was <a>active</a> or not at
            some <var>initial moment</var> and at some <var>final moment</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To facilitate this, each <a>timed item</a> has an associated
            <dfn>previous active state</dfn> property that initially has the
            value <em>inactive</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a given <a>timed item</a> the events queued as a result of
            performing <a>seeked event dispatch</a> at <em>uneased local
            time</em> <var>t</var> is as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>timeline time</var> be the <a>time value</a> of the
                <a>timeline</a> with which the <a>timed item</a> is
                associated.
                The procedures for calculating the timeline time from a <a>timed
                item</a>'s <em>uneased local time</em> or the <a>current
                time</a> of a <a>player</a> are defined in <a

            <li>Let <var>timeline time</var> be the <a>time value</a> of the
                <a>timeline</a> with which the <a>timed item</a> is
                associated.
                The procedures for calculating the timeline time from a <a>timed

          <h4>Event dispatch and seeking a player</h4>
          <p>
            When a seek is performed on a <a>player</a> (see <a
            href="#performing-a-seek" class="sectionRef"></a>) <a>seeked event
            dispatch</a> is applied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to performing the seek, the <a>previous active state</a> of
            each <a>timed item</a> that is either the <a>source content</a> of
            the <a>player</a> or a descendent of the <a>source content</a> is
            updated to reflect whether the <a>timed item</a> is <a>active</a> or
            not at the moment prior to performing the seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a>time adjusted flag</a> of the <a>player</a> has been set,
            no update of the <a>previous active state</a> of the <a>source
            content</a> and its descendants is performed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <var>timeline time</var> used in the <a>seeked event
            dispatch</a> procedure is simply the <var>seek time</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the seek, the previous sample time of the
            <a>player</a> is updated to reflect the <var>seek time</var> and the
            <a>time adjusted flag</a>, if set, is cleared.
          </p>
          <p class="annotation">
            Suppressing events during seeking is necessary to provide performant
            seeking.
            It is also arguably the more intuitive behavior as, for example,
            when rewinding a cartoon one probably does not expect a bucketload
            of events to arrive as a result of traversing backwards over each
            <a>timed item</a>.

          <h4>Event dispatch and time adjustments</h4>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              Apart from seeking a <a>player</a>, making adjustments to the
              arrangement or timing of a player's <a>source content</a> can also
              cause the <a>timed items</a>' <a>local time</a> to jump.
              Like seeking, in such circumstances it is often not sensible to
              dispatch all the intermediate events but rather to employ
              <a>seeked event dispatch</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The range of circumstances where this behavior is necessary is
              quite broad when we consider the interdependencies in the timing
              of <a>timed items</a>.
              For example,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a>Timing groups</a> calculate their <a>intrinsic iteration
              duration</a> based on the <a>active duration</a> of their
              <a title="child timed item">children</a>.</li>
              <li>Children of a <a>sequence timing group</a> base their
              <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> on the <a>active
              duration</a> of sibling <a>timed items</a> that appear earlier in
              the group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As such, even small changes to the timing of a <a>timed item</a>
              can have knock-on effects that affect all other <a>timed items</a>
              <a title="associated with a player">associated</a> with the same
              player possibly causing their <a>local time</a> to jump.
              As a result, <a>seeked event dispatch</a> is employed for the
              <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a> and <em>all</em> its
              descendents whenever <em>any</em> change is made to the timing or
              arrangement of any of those <a>timed items</a>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Associated with each <a>player</a> is a <dfn>time adjusted
            flag</dfn> that is initially <code>false</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a>time adjusted flag</a> is set to <code>true</code> whenever
            any of the following actions is performed on any of the <a>timed
            items</a> <a title="associated with a player">associated</a> with

          <p>

                Ordering by creation order only is simpler and useful for the

                call a utility function that plays an animation but
                inconsiderately does not return the player) but that doesn't
                work for <code>Element.getCurrentPlayers</code> (unless we make
                creation order global?) and the two methods should probably use
                consistent ordering.

            A reverse method would be very useful here for effects like
            transitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior would be:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>If <code>currentTime</code> is beyond the <a>end
                time</a> of the <a>source content</a> seek back to the end of
                the <a>active interval</a>.
            <li>Set <code>playbackRate</code> to
                <code>-playbackRate</code>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This reflects how transitions work as well as common usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some objections:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Calling <code>reverse</code> twice should be a noop.</li>
            <li><a>Players</a> should be independent of their
                <a>source content</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some suggestions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Call it <code>reverseSource</code> to make the link to the the
                <a>source content</a> obvious and remove any expectation that
                calling it twice is a noop.</li>
            <li>Make <a>players</a> actually stop when they reach
                the end of their <a>source content</a> much like a video/DVD/CD
                player.
                This would eliminate the need for the reverse seek and would
                make calling twice a noop.</li>

                Representing these parameters has been a particularly
                contentious topic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current arrangement is somewhat awkward and has the
                following surprising behavior.
              </p>
              <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
                // I want to update the iteration duration
                anim.setTiming( { iterationDuration: 3 } );
                // But, uh-oh, I just clobbered all other timing information and
                // reset it to its default values
              </pre>
              <p>
                If you really just want to update the <a>iteration duration</a>
                you have to do the following:
              </p>
              <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
                // Update the iteration duration (the right way)
                var timing = anim.getTiming();
                timing.iterationDuration = 3;
                anim.setTiming(timing);
              </pre>
              <p>
                The primary advantages are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Minimises API surface area by re-using
                   <a>TimingDictionary</a>.</li>
                <li>Makes it obvious that changing the timing can have a big
                    impact.
                    For example, setting the <code>playbackRate</code> will
                    cause things to jump.
                    If you just want a smooth change to the <em>running</em>
                    playback rate, you want to update the <a>player playback
                    rate</a>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Some alternatives include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Adding a <code>Timing</code> <em>interface</em> that is
                    basically identical to <a>TimingDictionary</a>.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        However, we might want to make an exception for
                        <code>iterationDuration</code> so that on the dictionary
                        version this would be a union <code>(double or
                        DOMString)</code>
                        but in the interface it might be
                        <code>iterationDuration</code> and
                        <code>iterationDurationAsString</code> or perhaps
                        <code>iterationDuration.sec</code> and
                        <code>iterationDuration.string</code>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        An arrangement like the last one that would obviate the
                        need for a separate <code>iterationDuration</code>
                        member on <a>TimedItem</a> since you could always get
                        the computed value from
                        <code>iterationDuration.sec</code> and you easily reset
                        it to its intrinsic value or test if the value being
                        returned is the intrinsic value through
                        <code>iterationDuration.string</code>.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We'll want to do something similar for
                      <code>timingFunction</code> since in the future we'll add
                      a typed interface <code>TimingFunction</code> for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Note that this could be added subsequently alongside
                      <code>setTiming</code> / <code>getTiming</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Such member would probably be called
                      <code>specified</code> so code would read
                      <code>anim.specified.iterationDuration</code>..
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Rework <a>TimingDictionary</a> so every member defaults to
                    some kind of null value.
                    When creating a <a>TimedItem</a> the defaults would be set
                    before assigning the values from the <a>TimingDictionary</a>
                    and all such null values would be ignored.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This removes the surprising result described above but
                    makes it difficult to clobber all other values if that's
                    actually what you wanted.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Just put the specified timing members directly on
                  <a>TimedItem</a> and rename where they class
                  (<code>computedIterationDuration</code> and
                   <code>computedActiveDuration</code>).

              A finite real number greater than or equal to zero representing
              the number of iterations into the timed item at which to begin.
              For example, a value of 0.5 would cause the timed item to begin
              half-way through the first iteration.

              The <code>iterationCount</code> is effectively <em>added</em> to

            <p>
              Setting the <code>iterationStart</code> to a value greater than

              Therefore, code that is intended to be used with arbitrary
              <a>Animation</a> objects should test the concrete type of
              <code>target</code> before using it and not assume that it refers
              to an Element.

            <p class="issue">
              If SVG is extended to allow multiple targets (using, e.g.,
              <code>select="rect"</code>) then it might be most natural to
              represent that in the API but allowing the <code>target</code> to
              refer to multiple elements.

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The second parameter representing the animation effect may specify
            multiple properties, an <a>AnimationEffect</a> object, or even
            a callback object.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 3);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animB = new Animation(elem, animA.effect, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem, new PathAnimationEffect( ... ), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem,
  { 
    sample: function(time) { 
      if (time !== null) {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
      } else {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0;
      }
    },
    clone: function { return this; }
  }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p class="todo">
            Fill in the parameters for <a>PathAnimationEffect</a> above once
            we have decided on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third parameter representing the animation's timing, may
            simply be a number representing the <a>iteration duration</a> as
            above, or, to specify further timing properties such as the <a
            title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a>,
            a <a>TimingDictionary</a> can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim =
  new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { iterationDuration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is also possible to omit the timing parameter altogether in which
            case default timing values will be used.
            Since the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an animation is
            zero, and the default <code>fillMode</code> when constructing an
            <a>Animation</a> is <em>forwards</em>, it is possible to
            create animations that simply set a property without any
            interpolation as follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' });
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is particularly useful in combination with other <a
            title="animation">animations</a> or <a>timed
            items</a>.
            For example, fading an element before switching
            &lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
            follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new SeqGroup(
  [
    new Animation(elem, { opacity: '0%' }, 1),
    new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' })
  ]
);
          </pre>
          <p>
            Having created an <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a>, it
            can be played using
            <code>document.timeline.play(<var>anim</var>)</code>.
            For simple effects, the <a
            href="#extensions-to-the-element-interface"><code>Element.animate</code></a>
            shortcut is more convenient since it performs this last step
            automatically.

        <h3>The <code>PseudoElement</code> interface</h3>
        <p>
          Since <a>animations</a> may also target
          pseudo-elements, Web Animations API introduces the
          <a>PseudoElement</a> interface to represent such targets.

        </dl>
        <div class="feedbackWanted">
          <p>
            This is an interface that may be useful in other specifications and
            so there are a few considerations to bear in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Currently no validation is performed at all.
                You can set <code>pseudoElement</code> to
                &lsquo;<code>::batman</code>&rsquo; and we'll just ignore it
                when compositing (still need to define this).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is in order to provide better fallback.
                For example, if a UA doesn't support a particular pseudo-element
                it will still run the animation in terms of occupying time and
                firing events.
                There simply won't be any visual effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, we have a general pattern in this specification that
                constructors don't throw.
              </p>
              <p>
                So while this works for this API, is this behavior useful in
                other specifications?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The other issue is that we could just make <a>PseudoElement</a>
                have an optional <code>pseudoElement</code> attribute and use
                that everywhere instead of a union of <a>Element</a> or
                <a>PseudoElement</a> (see <a>AnimationTarget</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason we don't is that it complicates the 99% case where
                you're not using pseudo-elements. For example, you have to type
                <code>anim.target.element</code> which is what so many people
                don't like about SVG.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, again, this works for this specification, but is it ok for
                others?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              While we're at it, should we enforce using double-colons somehow?
            </li>
          </ul>

                In light of this consideration the following procedure has the

              <p>
                We probably want to include the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Sort <var>animation properties</var> lexicographically by
                    the Unicode codepoints that define each property
                    name.</li>
                <li>For user agents that support both a prefixed and an
                    unprefixed version of some CSS properties, remove all
                    prefixed properties from <var>animation properties</var>
                    where the corresponding unprefixed version is also
                    present.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                But we might also want to consider if we re-arrange the
                structure of the passed in object to more closely match CSS?
              </p>
              <p>
                It might be acceptable to support either:
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
              </pre>
              <p>
                or:
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
var anim = new Animation(elem,
  [{ offset: 0, left: '100px', right: '200px' }, ... ], 3);
              </pre>
              <p>
                but not:
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
var anim = new Animation(elem,
  { left: ['100px', ...], right: ['200px', ...] }, 3);
              </pre>
              <p>
                But I don't know how much that buys us and the second case is
                complicated anyway since it means you can't animate an offset
                property (maybe you can escape it?).

                The primary use case for this method is an application that
                wants to increase the speed of all animations targetting
                a particular element by a factor of 2 (not sure why and never
                mind that this will affect all sorts of other elements too).
              </p>
              <p>
                With only <code>getCurrentAnimations</code> a naïve author might
                write:
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
                elem.getCurrentAnimations().forEach(
                  function(anim) {
                    anim.getPlayer().playbackRate *= 2;
                  }
                );
              </pre>
              <p>
                However, if <code>elem</code> is the <a>target element</a> for
                two animations that have the same player, then those animations
                will be sped up by a factor of 4.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead the author needs to generate a unique list of players
                first, hence this method.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is this kind of situation common enough to warrant this method?
                Or is it likely that when performing this kind of operation
                you're mostly working with single animations and not timing
                groups (as otherwise this operation could affect many other
                elements)?

      <h2>Interaction with script</h2>
      <p class="todo">
        This section and onwards is awaiting significant revision.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web Animations model may be modified using the API defined in this
        specification.
        This iteraction between script execution and the regular operation of
        the model is defined as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changes made to the timing model are reflected immediately in the
            values returned by timing model interfaces.
            <span
            class="todo">(Need to be more specific here. Once the section
            numbers have stabilized we could put section numbers here.)</span>
            Similarly, timing model methods that operate on the current state
            of the model such as pausing or reversing are applied to
            a fully-updated timing model, that is, after all previous
            modifications have been incorporated.
          </p>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              For example, if an <a>Animation</a>'s <code>startTime</code> is
              changed via the API, the value returned when querying the
              animation's <code>endTime</code> will reflect updated state of the
              timing model immediately.
            </p>
            <pre class="example sh_javascript">
              // Initially startTime is 3 and endTime is 5
              anim.startTime = 4;
              alert(anim.endTime); // Displays '6'
            </pre>
            <p>
              The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
              timing model such as adding and removing children from
              a <a>TimingGroup</a>.

            Changes to the timing model other than <a
            href="#seeking-a-timed-item">seek operations</a> do not cause
            <a href="#timing-events">timing events</a> to be dispatched
            immediately.
            Instead, such events are dispatched upon the next sample as defined
            in <a href="#event-dispatch" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior of events with relation to seek operations is defined
            in <a href="#event-dispatch-and-seeking-a-player"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>

            <p>
              For example, if a series of modifications to the timing model in
              a single script block causes a <a>TimedItem</a>'s <a>item time</a>
              to jump from being outside the active interval, to inside the
              interval, and then outside again no events are fired as in the
              following example.
            </p>
            <pre class="example sh_javascript">
              // document.timeline.currentTime is 3

            I'm unsure if this is the desired behavior.
            Gecko, for example, forces a synchronous sample when a seek is
            performed.
            This certainly makes testing simpler but I'm not sure if this is
            a good idea or not.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Do we need to put some minimum requirement on when samples are
            performed?
            By the time the next script block executes can I assume the model is
            up to date?

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>
      <p>
        The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
        The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
        resource on which they are specified.
        For resources with the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
        [[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a
        href="svg-integration.html">Web Animations and SVG Integration</a>
        specification.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
        their MIME type.
        As a result, temporal addressing may not be supported in all situations
        where Web Animations content is used.

      <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Discarding past animations</h3>
        <p>
          If implementations are required to preserve all state associated with
          animations then the resources required by an animation could continue
          to increase without limit over time. For long-running animations, and
          particularly those where animations are added dynamically, this could
          lead to degraded performance and eventual failure.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            I'm not sure how to define this. We could say all animations with
            <code><var>end time converted to document time</var> &lt;
            <var>current document time</var> - 5min</code> can be discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, but what about crazy documents that put 1 million
            animations in a 5min span? Just leave that up to the browser.
            Also, what about mobile clients, is 5 min too long? Is this too
            prescriptive?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe, just make some suggestions (e.g. 1 min for mobile clients,
            5 min for desktop?) and then define an exception to throw if there
            is a seek to some time outside that window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, note that defining this in terms of past intervals is
            direction-specific but that's probably ok since most long-running
            animations will run forwards.
