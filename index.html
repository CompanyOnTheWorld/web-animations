      This is the abstract for your specification.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform.
        It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
        expose its features through declarative means.
        In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
        the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
        for scripting.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Use cases</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations model aims at three broad areas of application:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>User interface effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Animation can be used to give visual clues and feedback to make
              a user interface more readily comprehensible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a user action results in a table row being
              removed to represent an item being removed from a shopping cart.
              In such a case, fading the row to transparent and then shifting
              the subsequent rows up to fill the space over a few hundred
              milliseconds provides the user with clear feedback as to the
              results of their action as opposed to instantly removing the row
              from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this scenario not only are the animated effects of
              fading and shifting required, but so is synchronization, both
              between the animations, and between animations and scripted
              actions (removing the table row from the DOM after the animations
              have completed).
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Storytelling and visualisation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Another type of animation uses the animated effect to convey
              a story or represent some information.
              Unlike user interface effects which are largely a presentational
              adjunct to the content, these animations form an essential part of
              the content presented to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in an animated cartoon two cats fly through space
              to another planet leaving a rainbow trail behind them.
              After arriving at the planet a change of scene occurs and the user
              should decide whether or not the cats enter a magic mountain by
              selecting one of two preset destinations in the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              This scenario requires the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>animated effects for moving characters along a path as well as
                  warping a path (the rainbow trail),</li>
              <li>synchronization that allows some actions to happen
                  simultaneously (the two cats moving) and others in sequence
                  (the change of scene),</li>
              <li>play control to allow rewinding the cartoon, or changing its
                  playback rate to accommodate particular learning or
                  accessibility needs (particularly if audio or textual captions
                  are included as described in the next use case category),</li>
              <li>the ability to trigger alternate animations at different
                  points in the overall story.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Similar use cases in this category include visualising physical
              phenomena such as spring motion for educational purposes,
              or visualising data such as the prevalence of a disease over
              a geographical space over a year whereby animation is used to
              present the time-based component of the data.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Synchronizing media and animated effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Finally, animation is often used in conjunction with other media
              such as video and audio.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, the subtitles shown on a karaoke video may indicate
              the current position in the lyrics through a ball bouncing from
              one syllable to the next.
              In this scenario it is necessary to maintain strict
              synchronization between the audio and animation even in the face
              of user interaction such as rewinding or pausing the audio or
              network events such as a delay due to media buffering.
            </p>
            <p>
              A more complicated example of this category is applying a series
              of independent sound effects to an animated cartoon or adding
              a video as the background of an animated scene such that is cued
              to start mid-way into the scene.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The nature of these uses cases differs significantly and whilst Web
          Animations attempts to address each use case, technologies built on
          top of the Web Animations may expose features tailored towards more
          specific use cases rather catering to each scenario equally.
        </p>

        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a Web page.
          Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
          they are described in different terms.
          This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
          encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
          This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
          specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
          without any observable change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defining CSS Transitions, CSS Animations and SVG's animation features
          in terms of a common model opens up possibilities of synchronizing
          animations, interchanging their definitions, and manipulating them
          using a common programming interface regardless of their markup.
          To facilitate this process of redefining these features in terms of
          a common model, this specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding
          specification, which describes how CSS features can be implemented in
          terms of Web Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification
          which does the same for SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
          Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]].
          It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
          the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
          Animation can be removed.
          To this end, features not present in Web Animations that are part of
          SVG are described in full in the SVG and Web Animations integration
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programming interface component of this specification makes
          some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [[HTML5]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Overview of this specification</h3>
        <p>
          This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
          This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
          abstract model.
          The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
          and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

      <h2>Web Animations model overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
        independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
        model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces
        the values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100
            pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width
        for the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
        the animation model.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is entirely
          independent of previous inputs, the model may be described as
          stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are two apparent exceptions to the stateless behavior of the
          timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, events are fired when, for example, one sample falls
          on the opposite side of an animation's interval boundary to the
          previous sample.
          This is certainly stative behavior.
          However, events should be considered as a layer added on top of the
          core timing model.
          In the case where no event listeners are registered, the model is
          stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other exception to this stateless behavior is that a number of
          methods such as <code>pause</code> and <code>reverse</code> are
          defined in terms of the time at which they are called and are
          therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but, like events, are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the API,
          it has no influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not
          conflict with the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
          down a number of steps to each animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A hierarchy of time sources.
          Each node in the tree refers to a time source from which it derives
          its time.
          This parent time source is referred to here as the node's timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
          on, as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent
          cascade down to its descendants.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          animations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Time sources</h2>
      <p>
        In Web Animations timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
        where the nodes are called time sources.
        Time sources provide a <dfn>time value</dfn> for the purpose of deriving
        further time sources and for eventual input into the animation model.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        A future version or module may offer time sources based on UI gestures
        or other quantities that are less related to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time sources further separate the <a>time value</a> into
        a <em>current time value</em> and a <em>result time value</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>current time value</dfn> is a point of progress in the time
        source and is used for seeking the time source.

      <p>
        The <dfn>output time value</dfn> is the <a>current time value</a> with
        an optional transformation applied
        and is used for synchronizing consumers of the time source.
      </p>
      <p class="feedbackWanted">
        Other options for naming:
        <em>result time value</em> (<code>resultTime</code>),
        <em>filtered time value</em> (<code>filteredTime</code>),
        <em>child time value</em> (<code>childTime</code>),
        <em>sync time value</em> (<code>syncTime</code>)
        &hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        For simple time sources, and unless otherwise stated, the <a>current

      <div class="annotation">
        <p>
          This complexity arises from the fact that in other APIs
          <code>currentTime</code> is used both as the input for seeking (e.g.
          HTMLMediaController, HTMLMediaElement) and also as the output for
          syncing (e.g. HTMLMediaController).
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to be consistent in allowing <code>currentTime</code> to be
          used for seeking and we also want to allow such objects to be used as 
          time sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result we allow <code>currentTime</code> to do double-duty in
          simple cases, and introduce <code>outputTime</code> for cases where
          it is necessary to distinguish between the two times.

      <h2>The document timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Towards the root of the time hierarchy is the document time source.
        A <dfn>document time source</dfn> is associated with a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#the-document-object">Document</a>
        [[HTML5]]
        object and provides a monotonically increasing time value that begins at
        zero when the Document <a>begins to play</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A document time source <dfn>begins to play</dfn> at the earliest of the
        following possible moments:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>When a call is made to <code>play</code> on the
            <a>DocumentTimeSource</a>.</li>
        <li>The moment immediately prior to dispatching the "load" event of the
            document with which it is associated if the <code>autoplay</code>
            attribute on the <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> is <code>true</code> at
            that moment.
            <p>
              For HTML documents, this is the moment after the <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
              ">current document readiness</a> has changed to "complete" but
              before dispatching the load event.
              In terms of the timings defined in [[NAVIGATION-TIMING]], this
              occurs between the <em>domComplete</em> and
              <em>loadEventStart</em> timings.
            </p>
        <li>When the <code>autoplay</code> attribute is made newly
            <code>true</code> at a moment after opportunity 2.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Before a document time source <a>begins to play</a>, its <a>current time
        value</a> is <code>null</code>.
        Once a document time source has <a title="begins to play">begun to
        play</a> its immediate time value is zero and from that point onwards it
        reports the number of seconds since it <a title="begins to play">began
        to play</a> subject to the constraints on updating the time value in <a
        href="#interaction-with-script" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a document time source has begun to play it cannot be restarted or
        paused and continues to be non-<code>null</code> for the remainder of
        its lifetime.

      <h2>Timed items</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to time sources, the other actor in the Web Animations
        timing model is timed items.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Relationship to time sources</h3>
        <p>
          The complement of time sources&mdash;which produce time
          values&mdash;is timed items, which consume time values.
          The time source from which a timed item receives time values is called
          its <em>timeline</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of its timeline, each timed item is defined by an
          interval during which it is scheduled to be active.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/timeline.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          At time <em>t</em> timed items A and B are active.
          Timed item C is no longer active.
          Timed item D has yet to begin and is not active.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as being consumer of time values, timed items are also
          themselves time sources.
          After consuming a time value most timed values apply a transformation
          to the value and then pass it on as an <a>output time value</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>The active interval</h3>
        <p>
          The period that a timed item is scheduled to run is called the
          <dfn>active interval</dfn>.
          Each timed item has only one such interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the active interval is determined by the
          <dfn>start time</dfn> of the timed item but may be shifted by
          a <dfn>start delay</dfn> on the timed item.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>active
          duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship between the <a>start time</a>, <a>start delay</a>,
          and <a href="#calculating-the-active-duration">active duration</a> is
          illustrated below.

          item is brought forward by the delay.

        <h3>Local time and inherited time</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
            These different points of reference produce different <em>time
            spaces</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
            graphics.
            The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
            a coordinate space.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, since a timed item can specify its own start time, the
            time values produced by a timed item will be offset from those
            received from its time source.
            As a result we say that the timed item establishes a new time space
            which we call <em>local time</em> as illustrated below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/local-time.svg" width="600">
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            Inherited time and local time.<br>
            At time <var>t</var>, the inherited time is 2.5.<br>
            For timed item (a), the local time is 1.5.<br>
            For timed item (b), the local time is also 1.5 since local time is
            based on a timed item's start time only, and not on its start delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the point of a view of a given timed item we can talk about the
            following time spaces:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>Inherited time space</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              A time space that corresponds to the <a title="output time
              value">output time values</a> of the timed item's time source.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>Local time space</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              A time space whose zero time is the start time of the timed item
              (plus any accumulated <a>time drift</a>&mdash;see <a
              href="#seeking-a-timed-item" class="sectionRef"></a>).
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
            <dfn>document time space</dfn> which is equivalent to the
            <a>inherited time space</a> of the <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> of the
            <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">active

            Furthermore, timed items that allow repeating introduce a further
            time space, <a>iteration time space</a> (see <a

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          For a given timed item, the <dfn>inherited time</dfn> at a given
          moment is the value of the <dfn>output time value</dfn> of the time
          source. If no time source is associated with the timed item, the
          inherited time is <code>null</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the point of view of the API, the <a>inherited time</a> is
          based on the first matching condition of the following:
        </p>
        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>If <code>timeline</code> is <code>null</code>,</dt>
          <dd>return <code>null</code>.</dd>
          <dt>If <code>timeline</code> has an attribute
              <code>outputTime</code>,</dt>
          <dd>return that value.</dd>
          <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
          <dd>Return <code>timeline.currentTime</code>.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          For some calculations it is useful to be able to use zero when the
          <a>inherited time</a> is <code>null</code>. For this purpose we define
          the <dfn>effective inherited time</dfn> as the <a>inherited time</a>
          unless that value is <code>null</code> in which case the effective
          inherited time is zero.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Timed item states</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            At given moment, a timed item may be described as being in one of
            several overlapping states.
            These states are only established for the duration of a single
            sample and are primarily a convenience for defining the behavior of
            events and various API methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The different states are illustrated below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/timed-item-states.svg" width="700">
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            An example of the different states used for describing a timed item
            at a given time.
            Note that a timed item is considered to be in effect for all times
            inside the <a>active interval</a> as well as times outside the
            active interval where a <a>fill mode</a> is applied.
          </p>
          <p>
            These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
            follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>scheduled</dt>
            <dd>
              The current time falls before the item's <a>active interval</a>.
              This state is only used in conjunction with the <em>active</em>
              state to define <em>current</em> timed items.
            </dd>
            <dt>active</dt>
            <dd>
              The current time falls inside the item's <a>active interval</a>.
              Transitions to and from the active state trigger timing events as
              defined in <a href="#timing-events" class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>current</dt>
            <dd>
              The current time falls either before or inside the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
              This state is used to determine which animations are returned from
              the <code>getCurrentAnimations</code> method defined on the
              <code>Document</code> and <code>Element</code> interfaces.
            </dd>
            <dt>in effect</dt>
            <dd>
              The current time falls either inside the item's <a>active
              interval</a> or outside the interval but at a time where the
              item's <a>fill mode</a> (see <a href="#fill-behavior"
              class="sectionRef"></a>) causes it to affect its target.
              Timed items only pass on an output time value to descendent timed
              items or animation effects when the item is in effect.
              At all other times, the output time of a timed item is
              <code>null</code>.
            </dd>
          </dl>

        </div>
        <p>
          A timed item is <dfn>scheduled</dfn> if <em>either</em> of the

        <p>
          As well as scheduling timed items to run for a given interval, it is
          possible to make adjustments to their playback as they run by seeking
          their current position, pausing and resuming, and disabling the

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Changing the current playback position of a timed item can be used
            to rewind a timed item to its start point, fast-forward to a point
            in the future, or to provide ad-hoc synchronization between items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeking a timed item effectively creates an additional offset
            between the item and its time source.
            This offset is called the <em>time drift</em> and is illustrated
            below.

          Seeking is performed in response to a change to a timed item's
          <code>currentTime</code> attribute and is realised by adjusting the
          <em>time drift</em> or the <em>pause start time</em> of the item as

              <code>currentTime</code> should be set.</li>
          <li>The steps for adjusting the local time depend on the state of the
              <a>local pause state</a> as follows:

            Pausing can be used to temporarily suspend a timed item.
            Like seeking, pausing effectively causes the local time of a timed
            item to be offset from its time source and hence causes the <em>time
            drift</em> to be updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pausing before a timed item begins will cause the item to begin

          <h4>Calculating the time drift</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>time drift</a> value is both a stored and a
            calculated value.
            When a timed item is paused, the value is calculated from the
            <a>pause start time</a>.
            When a timed item is not paused, the stored value is used.
            The stored value is initially zero, and is updated when the item
            is unpaused or seeked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since pausing does not take effect prior to when a timed item
            begins, we first define the beginning of a timed item for the
            purposes of pausing as a timed item's <em>earliest moment</em>.
            The calculation is as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <dfn>earliest moment</dfn> = <code>min(0, startDelay)</code>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Using this definition we can define the value of <a>time drift</a>
            at a given moment as follows:
          </p>
          <dl class="switch">
            <dt>If the <a>local pause state</a> is true or
                the <a>zero run-time playback rate flag</a> is true,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the result of 
              <code><a>effective inherited time</a> - startTime -
              max(<a>pause start time</a>, <a>earliest moment</a>)</code>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the stored value for this property.
            </dd>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Calculating the local time</h4>
          <p>
            Having defined the <a>time drift</a> we can now define <a>local
            time</a> as described in <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>

        <h3>Cancelling a timed item</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            During playback it is sometimes useful to completely disable a timed
            item such that it has no effect.
            This is achieved by disassociating the timed item from its time
            source.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The procedure for cancelling a timed item is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the timed item's <code>timeline</code> attribute is
              <code>null</code>, return immediately.</li>
          <li>Record the current <a>inherited time</a> as <var>local
              time</var>.</li>
          <li>Record the current <a>document time</a> as <var>document
              time</var>.</li>
          <li>Record the <a>current iteration</a> as <var>iteration
              index</var>.</li>
          <li>If <code>timeline</code> is a timing group,
              remove this timed item from the group and set
              <code>timeline</code> to <code>null</code>.
              Otherwise simply set <code>timeline</code> to <code>null</code>.
              In either case, do not dispatch a <em>timingend</em> event on this
              timed item or any of its descendents.
          <li>Dispatch a <em>timingcancel</em> event at this timed item and
              its descendents using the stored values for
              <var>local time</var>, <var>document time</var>, and
              <var>iteration index</var>.</li>

        <h3>Playback control interface members</h3>

            <p>
              Returns the <a>effective local time</a> of the timed item.
            </p>
            <p>
              This differs from the definition of <a>local time</a> used
              elsewhere in the model in that when the <a>inherited time</a> time
              is <code>null</code> (e.g. because <code>timeline</code> is
              <code>null</code>, or because the timeline has a <code>null</code>
              time value) an inherited time of zero is used.
              This allows the item to be seeked prior to being attached to
              a time source.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value returned is calculated as follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <code>currentTime =
                    <a>effective inherited time</a> - startTime
                    - timeDrift</code>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Note that unlike the <code>currentTime</code> attribute on
              the <a>TimeSource</a> interface, this attribute can be set.
              Setting this property performs a seek operation according to the
              steps described in described in <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, as a result of the definition above, for
              <a>TimedItem</a> objects this property will never be
              <code>null</code>.
              Attempts to set this property to <code>null</code> will result in
              a <code>DOMException</code> of type

        <h3>Iteration intervals</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that a timed item should repeat
          a fixed number of times or even indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, a timed item can have multiple
          <a>iteration interval</a>s although typically only the interval
          corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <a>iteration
          duration</a>. Comparing the <a>iteration duration</a> and the
          <a href="#calculating-the-active-duration">active duration</a> we
          have:

          <dt>Active duration</dt>
          <dd>
            The time taken for the entire timed item to complete, including
            repetitions.

        <h3>Iteration time space</h3>
        <p>
          We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
          <a>local time and inherited time</a>.
          Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn>Iteration time space</dfn> is a time space whose zero time is the
          beginning of a timed item's current iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <dfn>active
          time</dfn> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
          interval.
          This time space, however, is not used in the API.
        </p>
        <p>
          These time spaces are illustrated below.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
          Animations defines <a>active time</a> and <a>iteration
          time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <a>active time space</a>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>active time</a> defined in <a

          never return a negative value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
          <dfn>document time space</dfn> which is equivalent to the <a>local

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          When a timed item repeats we must define the behavior at the iteration
          boundaries.
          For this and indeed for all interval-timing, Web Animations uses an
          endpoint-exclusive timing model.
          This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
          In interval notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>.
          This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
          sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated item, at local time 1s,
          the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced items, at inherited time 1s, only item B will be
          <a>active</a>; there is no overlap.
        </p>

          Illustration of end-point exclusive timing. For both repeated and
          sequenced timed items there is no overlap at the boundaries between
          intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
          href="#calculating-the-iteration-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and is illustrated below.

          After one iteration, the iteration time is 0, but after two iterations

        <h3>Speed control parameters</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The rate of play of a timed item can be controlled by setting its
            <em>playback rate</em>.
            For example, setting a playback rate of 2 will cause the item to run
            twice as fast.
            Likewise, a playback rate of -1 will cause the item to run
            backwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The playback rate is applied only to the <a>active interval</a> of
            a timed item and not to the time while it is delayed or filling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting a negative playback rate also has the effect of inverting
            the <a>fill mode</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two side of effects of changing the playback rate of
            a timed item that may be unexpected.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Changing the playback rate of an item in play can cause it to
                jump in position.
                For example, doubling the playback rate of an item that is
                a quarter of the way through its <a>active interval</a> will
                cause it to jump to the half-way point.</li>
            <li>Changing the playback rate of an item can change its
                <a>default active duration</a>.
                For example, doubling the playback rate of an item with an
                active interval that usually takes 3 seconds will make the
                active interval 1.5 seconds.
                This can cause knock-on effects if other timed items depend on
                this timed item's duration such as other children of a sequence
                timing group.</li>

            A flag to indicate special pause-like behavior is to be employed due

        <blockquote>
          The value of the <dfn>effective run-time playback rate</dfn> is the
          <a>run-time playback rate</a> if it is defined.

        <p>
          Setting a negative playback rate has the effect of inverting a timed

          </dd>
          <dt>Otherwise,
          <dd>
            the result depends on the value of <code>fillMode</code> as follows,

        <h3>Performing run-time speed control</h3>
        <p>
          The following procedure adjusts the <a>run-time playback rate</a>
          to <var>new rate</var> whilst maintaining the current <a>scaled
          active time</a>.  If the current <a>local time</a> is outside the
          active interval the distance from the interval is scaled according to
          the change in speed.
        </p>
        <div class="annotation">
          <p>
            Special handling is required for when the run-time playback rate is
            zero.
            Intuitively, this should pause the timed item at its current
            position however the way the model is designed that will not
            happen.
            Instead, the active duration will become infinite and the item will
            effectively jump back to the start position.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work around that by providing special handling for when the
            run-time playback rate is zero.
            This handling consists of the following strategy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When setting the <code>playbackRate</code> to zero, record the
                time as the pause time and basically employ pause behavior.
                Don't actually update the playback rate in this case.</li>

                <code>0</code> when <em>zero run-time playback rate</em>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
          takes an inherited time value and converts it to an <a>iteration
          time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this further transformations are applied before resulting at
          a final <a>output time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in this process is to calculate the boundary when the
          item is active, that is, the <a>active duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is illustrated below.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/active-duration-calculation.svg" width="650">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Calculation of the <a>active duration</a> is based on
          multiplying the <a>iteration duration</a> by the <a>iteration
          count</a> and then dividing by the <a>playback rate</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process for calculating the <a>active duration</a> is normatively

        </p>
        <p>
          Having established the <a>active duration</a>, the process for
          transforming a timed item's <a>inherited time</a> into its

          (2) The <a>local time</a> is converted into an <a>active time</a> by

          (3) The <a>playback rate</a> and <a>iteration start</a> properties are

          (4) The <a>scaled active time</a> is then converted to an offset
          within a single iteration: the <a>iteration time</a>.<br>
          (5) The <a>iteration time</a> is converted into a <a>directed time</a>
          by incorporating the <a>playback direction</a>.<br>

        <h3>Calculating the duration</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Calculating the iteration duration</h4>
          <p>
            The <dfn>iteration duration</dfn>, unless overridden (see below), is
            simply its <em>intrinsic iteration duration</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of a timed item is zero,
            however some specific types of timed item such as timing groups
            override this behavior and provide an alternative intrinsic duration
            (see <a href="#the-intrinsic-duration-of-a-parallel-timing-group"
            class="sectionRef"></a> and <a
            href="#the-intrinsic-duration-of-a-sequence-timing-group"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Web Animations API also provides a means to
            override the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> and provide another
            value for the <a>iteration duration</a> via that
            <code>iterationDuration</code> attribute.
          </p>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              Since the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an animation is
              zero, and the default <code>fillMode</code> when constructing an
              <a>Animation</a> is <em>forwards</em>, it is possible to
              create animations that simply set a property without any
              interpolation as follows,

              For example, fading an element before switching
              &lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
              follows,

          <h4>Calculating the active duration</h4>
          <p>
            The active duration is based on the timed item's playback rate of
            which we have both the <a>default playback rate</a> and <a>run-time
            playback rate</a>.
            As a result, we can define both the <a>default active duration</a>
            and <a>run-time active duration</a>.
            As with the playback rate, the <a>default active duration</a> is
            used by timing groups to schedule children whilst the <a>run-time
            active duration</a> is used to control playback.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to calculate the <a>default active duration</a> we
            first define the <a>repeated duration</a> as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <dfn>repeated duration</dfn> =
              <code><a>iteration duration</a> *
                    <a>iterationCount</a></code>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The <dfn>default active duration</dfn> is calculated according
            to the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If the <a>default playback rate</a> is zero, return
              <code>Infinity</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Otherwise, return <code><a>repeated duration</a>
              / abs(<a>default playback rate</a>)</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            For the <a>run-time active duration</a>, we first define
            the <dfn>intrinsic run-time active duration</dfn> as the result of
            following the same steps for calculating the <a>default active
            duration</a> but substituting the <a>effective run-time playback
            rate</a> for the <a>default playback rate</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we define the <dfn>run-time active duration</dfn> as simply the
            <a>intrinsic run-time active duration</a> unless overridden by
            providing another value for the run-time active duration via the
            <code>activeDuration</code> attribute.

        <h3>Scaling the time</h3>
        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which a timed item
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the timed item to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides a variety of timing
          functions that scale the progress of a timed item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timing functions take an input time fraction in the range [0, 1] and
          produce a scaled output time fraction whose range is unbounded.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/timing-function-example.svg" width="350">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Example of a timing function that produces a ease-in effect.
          Given a input timing fraction of 0.7, the timing function scales the
          value to produce an output time fraction of 0.52.<br>
          By applying this timing function, time will appear to progress more
          slowly at first but then gradually progress more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such timing functions can be applied to an iteration of a timed item
          as a whole via the <a>TimedItem</a> interface or to a segment of
          a keyframe animation via the <a>KeyframeAnimationEffect</a>

        <h3>Scaling using a cubic Bézier curve</h3>
        <p>
          A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
          curve to scale the time.
          The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0,0) and (1,1) while two
          control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of the
          curve.
          Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
          lie within the range [0,1] such a curve produces a function that is
          used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
          (the <var>y</var> values).
          This arrangement is illustrated below.

          Input time fractions serve as <var>x</var> values of the curve, whilst

        <h3>Timing in discrete steps</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to scale a timed item's timing so that the timed item
          occurs in a series of discrete steps using a stepping function.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stepping function divides the input time into a specified number of
          intervals that are equal in duration.
          The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount equal to the
          interval duration once during each interval at the transition point
          which may be either the start, midpoint, or end of the interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          In keeping with Web Animation's model for endpoint exclusive interval
          timing (see <a href="#interval-timing" class="sectionRef"></a>), the
          output time at the transition point is the time <em>after</em>
          applying the increase (i.e. the top of the step).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some example step timing functions are illustrated below.
        </p>

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            To specify further timing properties such as the playback rate,
            a <a>TimingDictionary</a> can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            The animation effect parameter may specify multiple properties,
            an <a>AnimationEffect</a> object, or even a callback object.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 5);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animB = new Animation(elem, animA.effect, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem, new PathAnimationEffect( ... ), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem,
  { 
    sample: function(time) { 
      if (time !== null) {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
      } else {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0;
      }
    },
    clone: function { return this; }
  }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p class="todo">

          <p>
            This is an interface that may be useful in other specifications and
            so there are a few considerations to bear in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Currently no validation is performed at all.
                You can set <code>pseudoElement</code> to
                &lsquo;<code>::batman</code>&rsquo; and we'll just ignore it
                when compositing (still need to define this).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is in order to provide better fallback.
                For example, if a UA doesn't support a particular pseudo-element
                it will still run the animation in terms of occupying time and
                firing events.
                There simply won't be any visual effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, we have a general pattern in this specification that
                constructors don't throw.
              </p>
              <p>
                So while this works for this API, is this behavior useful in
                other specifications?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The other issue is that we could just make <a>PseudoElement</a>
                have an optional <code>pseudoElement</code> attribute and use
                that everywhere instead of a union of <a>Element</a> or
                <a>PseudoElement</a> (see <a>AnimationTarget</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason we don't is that it complicates the 99% case where
                you're not using pseudo-elements. For example, you have to type
                <code>anim.target.element</code> which is what so many people
                don't like about SVG.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, again, this works for this specification, but is it ok for
                others?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              While we're at it, should we enforce using double-colons somehow?

      <h2>Grouping and synchronization</h2>
      <div class="informative">
      <p>
        While it is possible to set the timing properties of animations
        individually, it is often useful to bundle animations together and
        control their timing as a group.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be used to share common timing properties as illustrated below:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/grouping-delay.svg" width="800">

        (a) Shows setting a delay of 5 seconds on individual animations.<br>
        (b) Produces the same effect by setting the delay on the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as sharing timing information, by grouping animations together
        they can be seeked, paused, and stopped as a unit.
      </p>
      </div>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of a group is based on the timing of the
          group. Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <em>iteration time</em>. That is, the children animate <em>inside</em>
          an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider repetition. If a group has an iteration count
          of 2, then the children of of the group will all play twice since they
          effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an timing group base their timing on the group's
          <var>iteration time</var>, when the group repeats, the children play
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an iteration count is specified for the children of a group as well
          as for the group the effect is as if the iteration count of the group
          was multiplied with the iteration count of the children.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition-and-animation-repetition.svg"
            width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Specifying an iteration count of 2 on an timing group and an
          iteration count of 3 on one of its children results in that child
          playing 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further result of the children of a group basing their timing on the
          group's <var>iteration time</var> is that they cannot animate outside
          of the group's <a>animation interval</a>.
          This is because the <var>iteration time</var> of a group will not
          change outside its animation interval.
          This allows groups to clip the playback of their children.

          a specified duration it has the effect of clipping the animation's
          duration.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Setting the playback rate of an timing group will speed up or
            slow down all children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing the playback direction of an timing group will change
            the direction of all children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applying a timing function to an timing group will affect the

        <h3>Types of groups</h3>
        <p>
          Groups can be used to provide synchronization behavior for its
          children.
          For example, one type of group runs its children in parallel, whilst
          another type runs the children in sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare the two arrangements illustrated below:

          Two types of timing groups.<br>
          (a) is a parallel group where all the children run simultaneously.<br>
          (b) is a sequence group where the children run in turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups can also contain other groups which allows for more
          sophisticated synchronization.

        <h3>Sequence timing groups</h3>
        <p>
          Sequence timing groups run their children in turn
          following their order in the group.
          This ordering is achieved by adjusting the <var>start time</var> of
          each child in the group.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Since the <var>start delay</var> is added to the <var>start
            time</var>, it can be used to adjust the timing of the <a>animation

          <h4>The start time of children of a sequence timing group</h4>
          <p>
            The start time for the children of a sequence timing group
            is calculated according to the following procedure:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let the <var>accumulated start time</var> be zero.
            <li>
              Iterate over each child in the group beginning with the first item
              in the group and proceeding to the last.
              For each child perform the following steps:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Let <var>child</var> be the current child.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let <code><var>child</var>.startTime</code> be
                  <var>accumulated start time</var>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let <var>accumulated start time</var> be
                  the <a>default end time</a> of <var>child</var> after updating
                  its <code>startTime</code>.

          </ol>

            When <code>activeDuration</code> is positive infinity the
            behavior is defined by IEEE 754-2008.
            As a result, if any of the children of a sequence timing group
            has an infinite <a>default active duration</a>, any children that
            occur later in the sequence will not play.

            <var>t</var> is calculated according to the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Convert <var>t</var> to the <var>time fraction</var>

        <h3>Custom animation effects</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            In some situations the animation effects provided by Web Animations
            may be insufficient.
            For example, the animation effects defined here are only able to
            target certain CSS properties and DOM attributes.
            They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
            href="#http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
            property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
            affecting the document content.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases where the provided animation effects do not provide
            needed functionality, an animation effect defined by script may be
            used.
            Such animation effects receive a time fraction from the timing
            model and are responsible for producing the animation effect
            corresponding to the specified time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using an animation effect defined in script it is possible to
            animate not only previously un-animatable attributes and properties,
            but potentially anything that is accessible via script, including
            even producing audio or creating vibrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, using an animation effect that draws to a <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
            element it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
            featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
            SVG.
            Compared to using the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
            interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
            independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
            accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
            in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
            additional programming.
          </p>
        </div> <!-- informative -->
        <div class="annotation">
          <p>
            I think we want two types of custom animation effects.
            Following is the general-purpose animate-anything kind of effect.
            The other type, which is not defined here, is the one that can
            participate in the animation sandwich just like any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            This, second, native-like animation effect, would have the
            following features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shares the same function signature as
                <code><a>AnimationEffect</a>.sample</code></li>
            <li>Gets passed the underlying value and passes out the animated
                value.</li>
            <li>Has a target property and is sorted against other
                <a>AnimationEffect</a> objects (including platform
                objects)</li>
            <li>Can be added as a child of
                a <a>GroupedAnimationEffect</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That's a bit more difficult since you have to be careful that the
            custom effect doesn't do anything naughty while you're in the
            middle of compositing the animation sandwich.
            I think we should postpone this until Web Animations 2.

          <h4>Execution order of custom animation effects</h4>
          <p>
            Custom animation effects allow authors to define animation effects
            using script.
            Such animation effects are not limited to a single CSS property or
            DOM attribute and therefore the steps for assessing their order of
            execution differs from regular animation effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Custom animation effects are executed after all other
            <a>AnimationEffect</a> objects have completed and applied their
            effects to their targets.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Need to define this more precisely.
            Are styles flushed?
            Presumably they are.
            Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
            animation effects and just do it once afterwards?
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the set of custom animation effects, the order of execution
            is mostly the same as that for other animation effects and is
            defined in <a href="#the-global-animation-stack"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
            However, custom animation effects may also override this
            ordering through the <code>priority</code> attribute, which, if
            defined, specifies the priority of the effects with lower numbers
            are executed sooner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In deciding which of two <a>CustomAnimationEffect</a> objects,
            <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, should be executed the following
            rules are applied.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> based on their
                <code>priority</code> such that lower priorities are sorted
                first.
                If either does not have a defined <code>priority</code>,
                then treat the priority as being positive infinity for the
                purposes of sorting.</li>
            <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority,
                sort according to the <code>startTime</code>s of the
                <a>TimedItem</a>s with which <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are
                associated such that earlier start times are sorted first.
            <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority and
                start time, sort by the position of the corresponding
                <a>Animation</a> objects occur within the animation tree (see

            That last point is quite wrong. I don't think we've specified

            But I wonder if it makes more sense to effectively enumerate all the

            I think we will also need to pass the previous time fraction.
            Animations will often use this to check if they are paused, playing
            in reverse etc.
            They can track this themselves but then you need a separate object
            everywhere you use it.

      <section>
        <h3>The Global Animation Stack</h3>
        <p>
          When multiple <a>in effect</a> animations target the same element, the
          animations are ordered into a stack which resolves how those 
          animations combine.
          This stack is sorted by animation <var>start time</var>.
          Where multiple animations have the same start time, those animations
          are sorted in document order (for animations from the DOM) and script
          order (for animations from the API). Script animations are always
          sorted after DOM animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other operations also generate animation stacks - for example, 
          grouping multiple animations using a 
          <code>GroupedAnimationEffect</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An animation stack may be thought of as a single stack with all
          animations sorted into it, or a stack per animating element, as
          animations on one element cannot effect the course of animations on 
          another element.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The start time of an animation refers to the time when the animation
          is specified to begin as recorded in the
          <code>TimedItem.startTime</code> property, that is, before applying
          any <var>start delay</var>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The stacking order of animations is independent of the
          current play direction of individual animations and animation
          groups.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Resolving Animation Stacks</h3>
        <p>
          In order to resolve an animation stack, an initial animation
          value is required for each element and property animated by the
          stack.
          To calculate a current animation value for elements and properties
          from an animation stack, an animation value is generated for each
          animation in the stack 
          (see <a href="#calculating-animation-values" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          The cumulative animation result for each element and property is first
          initialised to the relevant initial animation value.
          Starting at the bottom of the stack (i.e. earliest start time) and
          working up, as animation results are encountered for an element
          and property, these are merged into the cumulative animation result
          using the animation combinator stored in the 
          <code>AnimationEffect</code> that generated the result.
          Once all animation results in the stack are processed, the resulting
          cumulative animation values are the current animation values for
          each property of each element that is animated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Animation combinators</h3>
        <p>
          When an animation applies to a target and property that animations
          earlier in the animation stack have already applied to, the
          cumulative animation result from the stack is composited with the new
          animation to produce a new cumulative animation result.
          The possible combinators are defined by the <a>CompositeOperation</a>
          enumeration.

        <section>
          <h4>The REPLACE combinator</h4>
          <p>
            When an animation <code>a</code> is composited over a cumulative
            animation result <code>c</code> using the REPLACE combinator, the
            new cumulative animation result is always <code>a</code>.

            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the ACCUMULATE
            combinator, the effective transform of <code>a</code> is calculated.
            This transform is then post-multiplied to the cumulative animation
            result to generate a new cumulative animation result.
          </p>

            When a transform animation <code>a</code> is composited over a

          <p>
            When a simple animation (i.e. an animation which is not a path
            animation nor a transform animation) <code>a</code> is composited
            over a cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the
            ACCUMULATE combinator, the new cumulative animation result is the
            sum of <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, clipped if necessary to
            the appropriate domain.

          <h4>The MERGE combinator</h4>
          <p>
            All MERGE operators are governed by an interpolation parameter
            <code>p</code> that is calculated as the ratio of
            <code>(currentTime - parent.startTime)
            / parent.animationDuration</code>, where <code>parent</code> is the
            <code>AnimationTemplate</code> which references the
            <code>AnimationEffect</code> that is being composited.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a path animation <code>a</code> is composited over a
            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the MERGE
            combinator, the effective transform of <code>a</code> is
            calculated.
            This transform is then interpolated with <code>c</code> using the
            rules provided in [[!CSS3-2D-TRANSFORMS]] to provide the new
            cumulative animation result.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a transform animation <code>a</code> is composited over a
            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the MERGE
            combinator, <code>a</code> is interpolated with <code>c</code>
            using the rules provide in [[!CSS3-2D-TRANSFORMS]] to provide the 
            new cumulative animation result.
          </p>

            When a simple animation <code>a</code> is composited over a
            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the MERGE
            combinator, the new cumulative animation result is calculated as
            the weighted sum of <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, with weights
            of <code>(1-p)</code> and <code>p</code> respectively.

            !important rules from all other stylesheets act with a higher priority
            than the override stylesheet.

            The override stylesheet is regenerated for each timepoint in a

      <h2>Timing events</h2>
      <p>

      <div class="annotation">
        <p><strong>Relationship to CSS and SVG events</strong></p>
        <p>
          CSS defines <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s and SVG defines <code>TimeEvent</code>s.
          The proposal here is to dispatch <a>TimingEvent</a>s in parallel to
          these events.
          This has the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is possible to register for <em>just</em> CSS animation events,
          or <em>just</em> CSS transition events, or <em>just</em> SVG time
          events, or <em>all</em> animation-related events
          (by registering for the timing events defined here).</li>
          <li>Backwards compatibility&mdash;existing content continues to work
          as is.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An alternative is to make CSS and SVG events subclass
          <a>TimingEvent</a> and just fire the one event.
          Two issues arrive with this.
          Firstly, the event type would change on the subclasses so it wouldn't
          be possible to catch all "start" events, for example.
          Secondly, the propagation path for SVG events is different since they
          are fired at the animation template element rather than the animation
          target element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there may be alternative approaches here such as
          augmenting CSS Animation events only and firing them from the API
          (although that may cause compatibility issues when SVG animations
          start reporting events to content expecting only CSS animations).

                I think document time will be much more useful than global time.
                For the rarer case that you want to synchronise animations
                between documents using events, I anticipate
                <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> will have a method to convert
                a document to global time and vice-versa and/or convert times
                from one <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> to another
                <a>DocumentTimeSource</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we come to define animations that aren't necessarily linked
                to a document time source we'll need to make this nullable or
                redefine it to mean "root time source".

            Other potential event types for a later version:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>pause</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever <code>paused</code> is newly true.<br>
              Use case: show a graphic overlay to mark a cartoon as paused.<br>
              Likewise <em>unpause</em>.</li>
            <li><em>seek</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever <code>currentTime</code> is set on the item or an
              ancestor.<br>
              Use case: Acts as a signal that intermediate events may have been
              dropped (see <a href="#event-dispatch-during-seeking"
              class="sectionRef"></a>).
              For example, if you have an iteration event handler that assumes
              it will get one call per iteration, then a seek event would be
              a cue that you need to check <code>iterationIndex</code> and
              adjust.
              Also, if you were implementing something like SVG's syncbase
              timing with script you often need to do some bookkeeping on
              a seek.
            </li>
            <li><em>directionchange</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever the effective direction of the item changes (due to
              the direction attribute, changes to playbackRate, calling reverse
              etc. on either the item or an ancestor)<br>
              Use case: update UI to represent rewinding;
              stop audio when playing backwards to prevent secretly encoded
              messages being revealed.
            </li>
            <li><em>newanimation</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever a new <a>Animation</a> object is created.
              Use case: a timeline debugger. You want to show all animations
              that are playing or yet-to-play.
              Using this event (and <code>document.getCurrentAnimations</code>?)
              you could build up a timegraph.
              <p>
                I think this sort of event and this sort of use case would fit
                the MutationObserver pattern well.
                We could introduce a whole class of mutation records targetted
                at debugging (e.g. <em>timewindowchange</em>)
              </p>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, although this is a bit different to a regular event (since
            it's qualified by a parameter), it seems like it might be nice to be
            able to do something like:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
            anim.onprogress(0.8,
             function() {
              // Issue a request to prefetch the next episode
             });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It would be called whenever you got a sample where
            <code>iterationTime</code> &ge; <var>progress</var> was newly true.

        <h4>Event dispatch</h4>
        <p>
          The <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#glossary-propagation-path">propagation
          path</a> for all events depends on the <a>TimedItem</a> where the
          status change took place.
          If the item is an <a>Animation</a> with a <code>target</code> that is
          not <code>null</code>, the propagation path follows the usual <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow">DOM event
          flow</a> from <code>DefaultView</code> down the parent chain to
          <code>target</code> and finally to the
          <a>TimedItem</a> where the status change took place.
          Otherwise, the propagation path is simply the <code>TimedItem</code>
          object itself.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that unlike <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s in CSS, and <code>TimeEvent</code>s in
          SVG which target an Element, the target of a <a>TimingEvent</a> is
          a <a>TimedItem</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Web Animations makes no guarantees about the time between
          successive frames of animation, it is possible that the time when
          a change in state that should produce an event is scheduled to occur
          does not line up with a frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, the events that should be dispatched when sampling the model
          is based on the interval between samples as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let <var>previous sample</var> be the moment when the timing model
            was last sampled, recorded in document time.
            If there was no previous sample, then let <var>previous sample</var>
            be -1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>current sample</var> be the current document time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>progress interval</var> be the interval (<var>previous
            sample</var>, <var>current sample</var>].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The events to be dispatched are therefore those whose document time
          lies within <var>progress interval</var>.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            This description fails to account for newly-added animations,
            removed animations, and other tree surgery.
            For example, if I have a sample at t=3s, I add an animation whose
            animation interval starts at t=2s, and then conduct another sample
            at t=4s, the <em>timingstart</em> event should fire even though the
            event's document time lies outside the progress interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could possibly fix this by making the previous sample times and
            current sample times per-<a>TimedItem</a> but that won't work for
            repeating groups.
            Needs work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            This last part here requires calculating document times (both for
            testing against the progress interval and also for filling in the
            <code>documentTime</code> property of the event) and that's hard to
            calculate since our current model allows non-invertible timing
            functions on groups.
            That means you can't easily just traverse the descendants (by child
            and iteration) and generate a list of interval and iteration
            boundaries then filter out the ones that don't fit in the interval
            because you can't easily convert from local time to document time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can, of course, convert from document time to local time
            and while that's probably enough to tell if there was an interval or
            iteration edge or not, it's not enough to determine the exact time
            at which it occurred (to fill in the event parameters).
          </p>
          <p>
            A complex example is where you have an group whose iteration time
            goes from 0 to 1.5 to 0.7 back to 1.
            Suppose you have a child animation that finishes its animation
            interval at 80% of the way through the parent's iteration interval.
            It would then finish, do nothing, then start reversing part-way,
            then finish again.
            In that case I think you expect to get: start, finish, start,
            finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's probably not impossible, so long as we allow for the fact that
            the inverse may have several (even equal) roots but it sounds tricky
            and possibly expensive to calculate on each iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think we might need to re-consider allowing non-invertible timing
            functions on groups.
            Alternatively we could say that the children of a group with
            a non-interval timing function don't generate events.
            Or, alternatively again, that they occur on the non-transformed
            times.
          </p>
          <p>
            This final options of making event times untransformed times is not
            such a bad option, especially if we split time transformations into
            a separate step and perhaps even a separate interface.
            It's similar to some vector graphics editing programs that provide
            bitmap filter effects&mdash;often the bounding box of the filtered
            shape reflects the dimensions of the vector shape and not that of
            the bitmapped result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, in the case of an animation that bounces back and forth before
            resting at its final value, it's probably more useful to get just
            one end event when it finally rests than lots of little end/start
            events each time it crosses the 1.0 iteration time boundary.

        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            One implementation issue with events is that sometimes you find you
            suddenly have a large backlog of events to dispatch and this may
            have an adverse impact on performance.
            Some such situations include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have a short iteration duration, e.g. 50ms, then you get put
              in a background tab and throttled really low.
              On the next sample, you might have hundreds of iteration events to
              dispatch.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have an arrangement of animations such that they keep spawning
              new ones for ever.
              You can easily get this in SVG using syncbase timing or in the
              model here by using repeating groups.
              In this case, you can have a lot of events to dispatch if you get
              throttled low.
              Once you have a global clock, you also encounter this situation
              when the computer goes to sleep since when it wakes up it will
              have a lot of start/end/iteration events to catch up on.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It seems like the Mutation Observer pattern might help here except,
            firstly, that might prevent simple usage such as:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate({ opacity: '0%' }, 1).onend =
   function() { elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem); };
          </pre>
          <p>
            Secondly, even using the observer pattern doesn't relieve the
            implementation of having to walk through the model and determine
            all the mutations that have occured and their corresponding times
            and this could be expensive if the computer has been asleep for
            a few days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option might be to set some implementation requirements that
            allow dropping events or automatic pausing when the time between
            samples is protracted (such as the device going to sleep).

        <h3>Event dispatch during seeking</h3>
        <p>
          The previous description of event dispatch applies when the timing
          model is sampled during normal playback (whether forwards or
          backwards).
          However, when a seek is performed by setting the
          <code>currentTime</code> of a <a>TimedItem</a>,
          a different behavior is employed.
          In effect, event dispatch is supressed until the seek is completed.
          After the seek has completed, events are dispatched based on comparing
          the before and after state of each <a>TimedItem</a> affected by the
          seek.
          Iteration events are not dispatched.
        </p>
        <p class="annotation">
          Supressing events during seeking is necessary to provide performant
          seeking.
          It is also arguably the more intuitive behavior as, for example,
          when rewinding a cartoon one probably does not expect a bucketload of
          events to arrive as a result of traversing backwards over each
          <a>TimedItem</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Should iteration events be dispatched?
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Prior to performing the seek on <var>item</var>,
              record whether it is <a>active</a> or not.</li>
          <li>If <var>item</var> is an <a>TimingGroup</a> record whether each
              descendent <a>TimedItem</a> is <a>active</a> or not.</li>
          <li>Perform the seek as described in <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>

          events</a> whose sequence is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Events are ordered by <code>documentTime</code></li>
          <li>For events with the same <code>documentTime</code>,
              sort by event type from first to last as follows:
              <em>timingcancel</em>, <em>timingend</em>,
              <em>timingiteration</em>, <em>timingstart</em>.
              <p class="note">
                Note that sorting end events before start events is consistent
                with the end-point exclusive nature of timing in Web
                Animations (see <a href="#interval-timing"
                class="sectionRef"></a>).
                When animation A ends at the same time as animation B begins,
                we can imagine that animation A ends an incredibly short amount
                of time before animation B begins such that there is no overlap.

            <a>TimingGroup</a>s then the events are dispatched as if the tree
            was sampled breadth-first such that events attached to ancestor
            <a>TimedItem</a>s are dispatched first.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="issue">
          What if the order is still unresolved, is it okay to leave it
          undefined?
          Can we use document order or script order here?
          It's tempting to use the same order as we use for compositing but
          remember that not everything that is timed is composited (e.g.
          groups).

      <h2>Querying current animations</h2>

        It is often useful to be able to access the animations currently in play
        or scheduled to play, that is <a>current</a> animations, including those
        which may have been defined declaratively rather than by using the API.
        To that end the following extensions are defined for
        the <a class="externalDFN"
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-document">Document</a>

        <a>active interval</a> but which are still <a>in effect</a> due to
        a <a>fill mode</a> are <em>not</em> returned by this method.
        This is because in order to return such animations, user agents would be
        required to maintain all animations with a forwards fill indefinitely.
        As a result the resources consumed by an animated document would
        steadily accumulate over time.

      <h2>Interaction with script</h2>
      <p>
        The Web Animations model may be modified using the API defined in this
        specification.
        This iteraction between script execution and the regular operation of
        the model is defined as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changes made to the timing model are reflected immediately in the
            values returned by timing model interfaces.
            <span
            class="todo">(Need to be more specific here. Once the section
            numbers have stabilized we could put section numbers here.)</span>
            Similarly, timing model methods that operate on the current state
            of the model such as pausing or reversing are applied to
            a fully-updated timing model, that is, after all previous
            modifications have been incorporated.
          </p>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              For example, if an <a>Animation</a>'s <code>startTime</code> is
              changed via the API, the value returned when querying the
              animation's <code>endTime</code> will reflect updated state of the
              timing model immediately.
            </p>
            <pre class="example sh_javascript">
              // Initially startTime is 3 and endTime is 5
              anim.startTime = 4;
              alert(anim.endTime); // Displays '6'
            </pre>
            <p>
              The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
              timing model such as adding and removing children from
              a <a>TimingGroup</a>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changes to the timing model other than <a
            href="#seeking-a-timed-item">seek operations</a> do not cause
            <a href="#timing-events">timing events</a> to be dispatched
            immediately.
            Instead, such events are dispatched upon the next sample as defined
            in <a href="#event-dispatch" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior of events with relation to seek operations is defined
            in <a href="#event-dispatch-during-seeking" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              For example, if a series of modifications to the timing model in
              a single script block causes a <a>TimedItem</a>'s <a>item time</a>
              to jump from being outside the active interval, to inside the
              interval, and then outside again no events are fired as in the

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>
      <p>
        The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
        The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
        resource on which they are specified.
        For resources with the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
        [[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a

      <p class="note">
        Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
        their MIME type.

          to increase without limit over time. For long-running animations, and
          particularly those where animations are added dynamically, this could
          lead to degraded performance and eventual failure.

            I'm not sure how to define this. We could say all animations with
            <code><var>end time converted to document time</var> &lt;
            <var>current document time</var> - 5min</code> can be discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, but what about crazy documents that put 1 million
            animations in a 5min span? Just leave that up to the browser.
            Also, what about mobile clients, is 5 min too long? Is this too
            prescriptive?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe, just make some suggestions (e.g. 1 min for mobile clients,
            5 min for desktop?) and then define an exception to throw if there
            is a seek to some time outside that window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, note that defining this in terms of past intervals is
            direction-specific but that's probably ok since most long-running
            animations will run forwards.

        Thank you to Michiel &ldquo;Pomax&rdquo; Kamermans for help with the
        equations for a proposed smooth timing function although this feature
        has been deferred to a subsequent specification.
