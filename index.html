      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines features for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform by means of a programming interface.
        This interface is intended to be used both directly to easily produce
        animations using script, as well as a foundation for other
        specifications whose behavior can be defined in terms of these features.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a web page.
          Although the three specifications provide similar functionality,
          the syntaxes are incompatible and the animations cannot be
          interchanged.
          Furthermore, the interfaces available for interacting with animations
          from script are largely general-purpose interfaces with few features
          tuned specifically to the creation and manipulation of animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification proposes an abstract animations model that
          encompasses the abilities of both CSS and SVG, and additionally
          provides a programming interface to expose these features to script.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding specification,
          which describes how CSS features can be implemented in terms of Web 
          Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification, which
          describes how SVG features can be implemented in terms of Web
          Animations primitives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, this specification does not directly alter the behavior
          of CSS Transitions, CSS Animations, or SVG.
          However, Web Animations is intended to replace the SMIL Animation
          [[SMIL-ANIMATION]] specification where it is currently used to define
          the behavior of SVG's animation features.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification makes some additions to some interfaces defined in
          HTML5 [[HTML5]].

      <h2>Web Animations overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, Web Animations consists of two largely independent
        pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation model</em>.
        The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of Web Animations.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces the
        values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100 pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width for
        the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to the
        animation model.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is entirely
          independent of previous inputs, the model may be described as
          stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are two apparent exceptions to the stateless behavior of the
          timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, events are fired when, for example, one sample falls
          on the opposite side of an animation's interval boundary to the
          previous sample.
          This is certainly stative behavior.
          However, events should be considered as a layer added on top of the
          core timing model.
          In the case where no event listeners are registered, the model is
          stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other exception to this stateless behavior is that a number of
          methods such as <code>pause</code> and <code>reverse</code> are
          defined in terms of the time at which they are called and are
          therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but, like events, are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the API,
          it has no influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not
          conflict with the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
          down a number of steps to each animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A hierarchy of time sources.
          Each node in the tree refers to a time source from which it derives
          its time.
          This parent time source is referred to here as the node's timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, schedule, accelerated and so
          on, as a whole since the manipulations applied to the parent cascade
          down to its descendants.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          otherwise independent animations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Time sources</h2>
      <p>
        In Web Animations timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
        where the nodes are called time sources.
        Time sources provide a <dfn>time value</dfn> for the purpose of deriving
        further time sources and for eventual input into the animation model.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        A future version or module may offer time sources based on UI gestures
        or other quantities that are less related to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time sources are represented in the Web Animations <acronym
        title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> by the
        <a>TimeSource</a> interface.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The <code>TimeSource</code> interface</h3>
        <dl title="interface TimeSource" class="idl">
          <dt>readonly attribute double? currentTime</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The current <a>time value</a> of this time source in seconds.
              This value is updated each time the model is sampled (see <a
              href="#interaction-with-script" class="sectionRef"></a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that current time will be <code>null</code> if the time
              source cannot currently produce a time value.
              For example, a time source that derives its time from another time
              source will return <code>null</code> if the parent time source is
              not provided, is unavailable, or if the parent time source reports
              <code>null</code> as its <code>currentTime</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              Note that while <code>currentTime</code> is read-only in this
              interface, it is writeable in the derived interface
              <a>TimedItem</a>.

      <h2>The document timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Towards the root of the time hierarchy is the document time source.
        A document time source is associated with a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#the-document-object">Document</a>
        [[HTML5]]
        object and provides a monotonically increasing time value that begins at
        zero when the Document <a>begins to play</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A document time source <dfn>begins to play</dfn> at the earliest of the
        following possible moments:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>When a call is made to <code>play</code> on the
            <a>DocumentTimeSource</a>.</li>
        <li>The moment immediately prior to dispatching the "load" event of the
            document with which it is associated if the <code>autoplay</code>
            attribute on the <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> is <code>true</code> at
            that moment.
            <p>
              For HTML documents, this is the moment after the <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
              ">current document readiness</a> has changed to "complete" but
              before dispatching the load event.
              In terms of the timings defined in [[NAVIGATION-TIMING]], this
              occurs between the <em>domComplete</em> and
              <em>loadEventStart</em> timings.
            </p>
        <li>When the <code>autoplay</code> attribute is made newly
            <code>true</code> at a moment after opportunity 2.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Before a document time source <a>begins to play</a>, its <a>time
        value</a> is <code>null</code>.
        Once a document time source has begun to play its immediate time value
        is zero and from that point onwards, it reports the number of seconds
        since it <a title="begins to play">begun to play</a> subject to the
        constraints on updating the time value in <a
        href="#interaction-with-script" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a document time source has begun to play it cannot be restarted or
        paused and continues to be non-<code>null</code> for the remainder of
        its lifetime.
      </p>

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            To specify further timing properties such as the playback rate,
            a <a>TimingDictionary</a> can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            To share or re-used timing properties with another animation,
            a <a>Timing</a> object can be directly passed in as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Share the timing properties of animB with animA
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, animB.timing);

// Re-use the timing properties of animB in animC without sharing
var animC = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, animB.timing.clone());
          </pre>
          <p>
            The animation effect parameter may specify multiple properties,
            an <a>AnimationEffect</a> object, or even a callback object.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 5);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animB = new Animation(elem, animA.effect, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem, new PathAnimationEffect( ... ), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animC = new Animation(elem,
  { 
    sample: function(time) { 
      if (time !== null) {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
      } else {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0;
      }
    },
    clone: function { return this; }
  }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p class="todo">
            Fill in the parameters for <a>PathAnimationEffect</a> above once
            we have decided on them.

          <p class="todo">

        <h3>Animation targets and pseudo-elements</h3>
        <p>
          Animations may target not only regular elements but also
          pseudo-elements such as <code>::before</code> and
          <code>::first-line</code> [[!SELECT]].
        </p>
        <p>
          To represent pseudo-elements, we introduce the <a>PseudoElement</a>

        <div class="feedbackWanted">
          <p>
            This is an interface that may be useful in other specifications and
            so there are a few considerations to bear in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Currently no validation is performed at all.
                You can set <code>pseudoElement</code> to
                &lsquo;<code>::batman</code>&rsquo; and we'll just ignore it
                when compositing (still need to define this).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is in order to provide better fallback.
                For example, if a UA doesn't support a particular pseudo-element
                it will still run the animation in terms of occupying time and
                firing events.
                There simply won't be any visual effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, we have a general pattern in this specification that
                constructors don't throw.
              </p>
              <p>
                So while this works for this API, is this behavior useful in
                other specifications?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The other issue is that we could just make <a>PseudoElement</a>
                have an optional <code>pseudoElement</code> attribute and use
                that everywhere instead of a union of <a>Element</a> or
                <a>PseudoElement</a> (see <a>AnimationTarget</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason we don't is that it complicates the 99% case where
                you're not using pseudo-elements. For example, you have to type
                <code>anim.effect.targetElement.element</code> which is
                what so many people don't like about SVG.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, again, this works for this specification, but is it ok for
                others?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              While we're at it, should we enforce using double-colons somehow?
            </li>

          The period that an animation is animating is called the

          Each animation has only one such interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the animation interval is determined by the

          a <dfn>start delay</dfn> on the animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>animation

        <h3>Animation fill behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of the <a>animation interval</a>, an animation may still
          affect its target depending on its <dfn>fill mode</dfn>.
          The different modes are as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>none</dt>
          <dd>
            The animation does not affect its target outside of the

          </dd>
          <dt>forwards</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur later than the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will continue to apply to its target the
            animation value that was used at the end of the <a>animation
            interval</a>.

            For times that occur before the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will not affect its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>backwards</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur before the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will apply the same animation value that will be used at
            the start of the <a>animation interval</a>.

            For times that occur later than the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will not affect its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>both</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur before the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            backwards fill behavior is used.

            For times that occur after the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            forwards fill behavior is used.
          </dd>

          Some examples of the these fill modes are illustrated below.

          (b) fill mode &lsquo;forwards&rsquo;. After the animation interval has
              finished, the animation continues to apply a fill value to the

          At a given time, it is possible to describe an animation as <dfn>in

          However, the fill mode <em>does</em> have an effect on the
          calculation of the <a>animation time</a> and consequently the
          <a>iteration time</a> since these are defined only when the animation

        <h3>Animation repeat behavior</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that an animation's effect should repeat
          a fixed number of times or even indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>animation
          interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>animation interval</a>, an animation can have multiple
          <a>iteration interval</a>s although typically only the interval
          corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <a>iteration
          duration</a>. Comparing the <a>iteration duration</a> and the
          <a>animation duration</a> we have:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Iteration duration</dt>
          <dd>
            The time taken for a single iteration of the animation to complete.
          </dd>
          <dt>Animation duration</dt>
          <dd>
            The time taken for the entire animation effect to complete,
            including repetitions.
            This may be longer or shorter than the iteration duration.
          </dd>

        <h3>Time spaces</h3>
        <p>
          Times in Web Animations are relative to some point of reference. These
          different points of reference produce different time spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
          graphics.
          The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
          a coordinate space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within Web Animations, some of the common time spaces are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>Document time space</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the start time of the document
            timeline as defined in <a href="#start-of-the-timeline"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Item time space</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the start of the animation's
            <a>start time</a>.<br>
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Animation time space</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the beginning of the animation's
            <a>animation interval</a>.<br>
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Iteration time space</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the beginning of the <a>current
            iteration</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces, when animation groups are used (see
          <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization" class="sectionRef"></a>) we
          can talk about the <dfn>parent iteration time space</dfn>.
          The zero time of <a>parent iteration time space</a> is the beginning
          of the parent animation group's <a>current iteration</a>.
          When animation groups are not used, this is equivalent to <a>document
          time space</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, <a>item time space</a> is used for operations confined to
          a single animation such as <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item">seeking</a>
          and <a href="pausing-a-timed-item">pausing</a> whilst <a>parent
          iteration time space</a> is used to synchronize animations in a group
          and hence is the time space used to represent an animation's start and
          end time.
          <a>Animation time space</a> is not used directly in the Web Animations
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these time spaces are illustrated below.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
          Animations defines <a>animation time</a> and <a>iteration
          time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <a>animation time space</a>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>animation time</a> defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-animation-time" class="sectionRef"></a> will
          never return a negative value.

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          For intervals of time, Web Animations uses an endpoint-exclusive
          timing model. This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not. In interval
          notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>. This model
          provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and sequenced
          since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated animation, at animation time
          1s, the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced animation, in the absence of any fill mode,
          at parent iteration time 1s, only animation B can affect its target;
          there is no overlap.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/endpoint-exclusive-timing.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Illustration of end-point exclusive timing. For both repeated and
          sequenced animations there is no overlap at the boundaries between
          intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#animation-fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
          href="#calculating-the-unscaled-iteration-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and is illustrated below.

        <h3>Specifying timing properties</h3>
        <p>
          Timing properties are collected under the <code>Timing</code>
          interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this object is attached to a linked <a>Animation</a> or
          <a>AnimationGroup</a> (see <a href="#animation-templates"
          class="sectionRef"></a>) then it is readonly and attempting to set any
          of its properties will result in a DOMException of type
          <code>NoModificationAllowedError</code> being thrown.
          In order to modify the properties of a readonly object, it is
          necessary to first call the <code>unlink</code> method on the
          corresponding <a>Animation</a> or <a>AnimationGroup</a> object.
        </p>
        <p>
          When throwing a DOMException as a result of attempting to set
          a readonly property, <a>user agent</a>s that provide debugging
          feedback SHOULD also provide feedback indicating the reason that this
          object is readonly and the remedy described above.

              a parent time of zero is used.
              This allows the item to be seeked prior to being attached to

                    This isn't great. If you set the playback rate to zero at

            Since the intrinsic duration of an animation is zero, and the

        <p>

          The <a>adjusted animation time</a> is then divided into intervals
          resulting in the <a>unscaled iteration time</a>.
          Following this, timing manipulations specified on the timed item are
          applied to the <a>unscaled iteration time</a> to produce the
          <a>iteration time</a>.

          <p>
            Timed items may be paused and resumed independently of the parent
            animation group they belong to.
            The effect is that the time of the item lags behind that of its
            parent.
            This lag is called the <var>time drift</var> and acts as an
            additional delay added to the <var>start time</var> of the item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Timed elements that do not have a parent animation group may still
            be paused and resumed.
            However, except for the case of the document timeline, there will be
            no observable effect until the element is attached to a parent
            animation group.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Pausing and seeking are realised using two additional inputs to the
          timing model, the <dfn>time drift</dfn> which is exposed as the
          <code>timeDrift</code> property on the <a>TimedItem</a> interface, and
          the <dfn>pause start time</dfn> which is internal to the model.
          Both the <var>time drift</var> and <var>pause start time</var> are
          initially zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pausing behavior is realised through the specific steps defined
          for calculating and updating the <code>locallyPaused</code> and
          <code>timeDrift</code> properties of the <a>TimedItem</a> interface.

        <h3>Seeking a timed item</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Seeking, like pausing, has the effect of causing a timed item's
            time to drift from that of its parent animation group.
            Consequently, it is also uses the <a>time drift</a> and
            <a>pause start time</a> concepts on which pausing is based.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Seeking is performed in response to a change to a timed item's
          <code>currentTime</code> property and is realised by adjusting the
          <code>timeDrift</code> property or the internal <a>pause start
          time</a> of the item as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>seek time</var> be the new value to which
              <code>currentTime</code> should be set.</li>
          <li>The steps for adjusting the item time depend on the state of the
              <code>locallyPaused</code> property as follows:
            <dl class="switch">
              <dt>If <code>locallyPaused</code> is true,</dt>
              <dd>
                Set <a>pause start time</a> to <var>seek time</var>.
              </dd>
              <dt>If <code>locallyPaused</code> is false,</dt>
              <dd>
                Set the stored value for <code>timeDrift</code> to
                the result of evaluating
                <code><a>effective parent time</a> - startTime -
                      <var>seek time</var></code>.

        <p class="note">
          Note that the <code>currentTime</code> property is not actually set
          directly but is updated to the seek time as a result of the

      <h2>Scaling the time</h2>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which an animation
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the animation to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides a variety of timing
          functions that scale the progress of an animation.
          In situations where the timing functions defined here are
          insufficient, it is possible to provide a custom script-based timing
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all cases, timing functions take an input time and produce a scaled
          output time.
        </p>
        <p class="todo">
          Diagram
        </p>
        <p>
          Such timing functions can be applied to an iteration of an animation
          as a whole via the <a>TimedItem</a> interface or to a segment of
          a keyframe animation via the <a>KeyframeAnimationEffect</a>
          interface.

        <h3>The <code>TimingFunction</code> interface</h3>
        <p>
          The timing functions provided by Web Animations share a common
          <a>TimingFunction</a> interface as defined below.
        </p>
        <dl title="interface TimingFunction" class="idl">

              transformation on the value to produce an output time fraction
              (typically, but not necessarily, also in the range [0, 1]).
            </p>

                  being performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some timing functions, for example, may produce different
                  results depending on the animation values involved to produce
                  an even rate of change.

                  directly by user code for the purpose of testing or re-using
                  the scaling operation in another context.

        <h3>Scaling using a cubic Bézier curve</h3>
        <p>
          A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
          curve to scale the time.
          The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0,0) and (1,1) while two
          control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of the
          curve.
          Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
          lie within the range [0,1] such a curve produces a function that is
          used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
          (the <var>y</var> values).
          This arrangement is illustrated below.

        <h3>Timing in discrete steps</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to scale an animation's timing so that the animation
          occurs in a series of discrete steps using a stepping function.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stepping function divides the input time into a specified number of
          intervals that are equal in duration.
          The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount equal to the
          interval duration once during each interval at the transition point
          which may be either the start, midpoint, or end of the interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          In keeping with Web Animation's model for endpoint exclusive interval
          timing (see <a href="#interval-timing" class="sectionRef"></a>), the
          output time at the transition point is the time <em>after</em>
          applying the increase (i.e. the top of the step).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some example step timing functions are illustrated below.

          one step is specified whilst the second row shows the same for three

            Need help from someone who knows math.
            We'd like to be able to have a function with many extrema.
            Ideally, something like Catmull-Rom curves would be great where you
            could just say:
          </p>
          <p>

            The trouble is that Catmull-Rom curves won't necessarily give you

      <h2>Grouping and synchronization</h2>
      <div class="informative">
      <p>
        While it is possible to set the timing properties of animations
        individually, it is often useful to bundle animations together and
        control their timing as a group.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be used to share common timing properties as illustrated below:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/grouping-delay.svg" width="800">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Using groups to share common timing properties.<br>
        (a) Shows setting a delay of 5 seconds on individual animations.<br>
        (b) Produces the same effect by setting the delay on the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as sharing timing information, by grouping animations together
        they can be seeked, paused, and stopped as a unit.
      </p>
      </div>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of a group is based on the timing of the
          group. Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <em>iteration time</em>. That is, the children animate <em>inside</em>
          an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider repetition. If a group has an iteration count
          of 2, then the children of of the group will all play twice since they
          effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an animation group base their timing on the group's
          <var>iteration time</var>, when the group repeats, the children play
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an iteration count is specified for the children of a group as well
          as for the group the effect is as if the iteration count of the group
          was multiplied with the iteration count of the children.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition-and-animation-repetition.svg"
            width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Specifying an iteration count of 2 on an animation group and an
          iteration count of 3 on one of its children results in that child
          playing 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further result of the children of a group basing their timing on the
          group's <var>iteration time</var> is that they cannot animate outside
          of the group's <a>animation interval</a>.
          This is because the <var>iteration time</var> of a group will not
          change outside its animation interval.
          This allows groups to clip the playback of their children.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-clipping.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          In the first instance, an animation has a negative delay and an
          infinite iteration count.<br>
          However, when a similar animation is placed inside a group with
          a specified duration it has the effect of clipping the animation's
          duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some further consequences of group children basing their timing on
          their parent group's <var>iteration time</var> are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Setting the playback rate of an animation group will speed up or
            slow down all children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing the playback direction of an animation group will change
            the direction of all children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applying a timing function to an animation group will affect the
            playback rate of all children.

        <h3>Types of groups</h3>
        <p>
          Groups can be used to provide synchronization behavior for its
          children.
          For example, one type of group runs its children in parallel, whilst
          another type runs the children in sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare the two arrangements illustrated below:

          (b) is a sequence group where the children run in turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups can also contain other groups which allows for more
          sophisticated synchronization.

          We have previously referred to the document timeline as the context in
          which animation takes places.
          Likewise we have referred to the <em>document time space</em> as the
          master time space which contains other time spaces.
          The document timeline is, in fact, a parallel animation group

          <li>
            Calls to <code>cancel()</code> will result in a DOMException of type

            <p>
              As a result, the <var>parent iteration time</var> is the number of

          <p>
            On creating an <code>AnimationGroupInstance</code> corresponding to
            the document timeline, the following steps are performed.
          </p>
          <ol>

              Set the <var>start time</var> to the current <var>parent

            </li>
            <li>
              Set the <var>pause state</var> to <code>true</code>.

            Furthermore, seeking the timeline before it is unpaused provides
            intuitive results without special casing the algorithm for seeking

            Rather, the timeline must be actually unpaused at the appropriate
            moment such that scripts that execute during page loading (for
            example, in response to the load event) can make assumptions about
            the pause state of the timeline.

          <p>
            Any call to <code>pause</code> or <code>unpause</code> on the

              the start of animation is necessary for backwards compatibility
              with SVG.
            </p>
            <p>
              This override behavior applies even if the timeline has already
              been unpaused since changing the <code>timelineStart</code>
              property could return the timeline to a state where the automatic
              unpause behavior would otherwise apply.

        <h3>Sequence animation groups</h3>
        <p>
          Sequence animation groups run their children in turn
          following their order in the group.
          This ordering is achieved by adjusting the <var>start time</var> of
          each child in the group.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Since the <var>start delay</var> is added to the <var>start
            time</var>, it can be used to adjust the timing of the <a>animation
            interval</a> relative to calculated <var>start time</var> as shown

            A negative <var>start delay</var> can be used to cause the
            <a>animation interval</a> of two children to overlap.
            Note that the <var>start delay</var> affects the <var>start

          <p>
            The start time for the children of a sequence animation group
            is calculated according to the following procedure:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let the <var>accumulated start time</var> be zero.
            <li>
              Iterate over each child in the group beginning with the first item
              in the group and proceeding to the last.
              For each child perform the following steps:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Let <var>child</var> be the current child.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let <code><var>child</var>.startTime</code> be
                  <var>accumulated start time</var>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let <var>accumulated start time</var> be
                  <code><var>child</var>.endTime</code>.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            When <code>animationDuration</code> is positive infinity the
            behavior is defined by IEEE 754-2008.
            As a result, if any of the children of a sequence animation group
            has an infinite animation duration, any children that occur
            later in the sequence will not play.

        <h3>Custom animation effects</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            In some situations the animation effects provided by Web Animations
            may be insufficient.
            For example, the animation effects defined here are only able to
            target certain CSS properties and DOM attributes.
            They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
            href="#http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
            property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
            affecting the document content.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases where the provided animation effects do not provided
            needed functionality, an animation effect defined by script may be
            used.
            Such animation effects receive a time fraction from the timing
            model and are responsible for producing the animation effect
            corresponding to the specified time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using an animation effect defined in script it is possible to
            animate not only previously un-animatable attributes and properties,
            but potentially anything that is accessible via script, including
            even producing audio or creating vibrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, using an animation effect that draws to a <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
            element it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
            featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
            SVG.
            Compared to using the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
            interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
            independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
            accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
            in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
            additional programming.

            I think we want two types of custom animation effects.
            Following is the general-purpose animate-anything kind of effect.
            The other type, which is not defined here, is the one that can
            participate in the animation sandwich just like any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            This, second, native-like animation effect, would have the
            following features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shares the same function signature as
                <code><a>AnimationEffect</a>.sample</code></li>
            <li>Gets passed the underlying value and passes out the animated
                value.</li>
            <li>Has a target property and is sorted against other
                <a>AnimationEffect</a> objects (including platform
                objects)</li>
            <li>Can be added as a child of
                a <a>GroupedAnimationEffect</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That's a bit more difficult since you have to be careful that the
            custom effect doesn't do anything naughty while you're in the
            middle of compositing the animation sandwich.
            I think we should postpone this until Web Animations 2.

          <h4>Execution order of custom animation effects</h4>
          <p>
            Custom animation effects allow authors to define animation effects
            using script.
            Such animation effects are not limited to a single CSS property or
            DOM attribute and therefore the steps for assessing their order of
            execution differs from regular animation effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Custom animation effects are executed after all other
            <a>AnimationEffect</a> objects have completed and applied their
            effects to their targets.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Need to define this more precisely.
            Are styles flushed?
            Presumably they are.
            Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
            animation effects and just do it once afterwards?
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the set of custom animation effects, the order of execution
            is mostly the same as that for other animation effects and is
            defined in <a href="#the-global-animation-stack"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
            However, custom animation effects may also override this
            ordering through the <code>priority</code> attribute, which, if
            defined, specifies the priority of the effects with lower numbers
            are executed sooner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In deciding which of two <a>CustomAnimationEffect</a> objects,
            <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, should be executed the following
            rules are applied.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> based on their
                <code>priority</code> such that lower priorities are sorted
                first.
                If either does not have a defined <code>priority</code>,
                then treat the priority as being positive infinity for the
                purposes of sorting.</li>
            <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority,
                sort according to the <code>startTime</code>s of the
                <a>TimedItem</a>s with which <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are
                associated such that earlier start times are sorted first.
            <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority and
                start time, sort by the position of the corresponding
                <a>Animation</a> objects occur within the animation tree (see
                issue below).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Items sorted earlier, are executed first.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            That last point is quite wrong. I don't think we've specified
            exactly what script order is in <a
            href="#the-global-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>.
            But I wonder if it makes more sense to effectively enumerate all the
            script-based nodes in the animation tree using some well-defined
            order and use that index.
            Can that be done efficiently?

            Do we need to pass in the <a>TimedItem</a> as well?
            If possible I'd prefer not to but it may necessary for some types of
            effect.
            Might be an additional parameter to add later if it proves
            necessary?
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            I think we will also need to pass the previous time fraction.
            Animations will often use this to check if they are paused, playing
            in reverse etc.
            They can track this themselves but then you need a separate object
            everywhere you use it.

        <h3>The Global Animation Stack</h3>
        <p>
          When multiple <a>in effect</a> animations target the same element, the
          animations are ordered into a stack which resolves how those 
          animations combine.
          This stack is sorted by animation <var>start time</var>.
          Where multiple animations have the same start time, those animations
          are sorted in document order (for animations from the DOM) and script
          order (for animations from the API). Script animations are always
          sorted after DOM animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other operations also generate animation stacks - for example, 
          grouping multiple animations using a 
          <code>GroupedAnimationEffect</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An animation stack may be thought of as a single stack with all
          animations sorted into it, or a stack per animating element, as
          animations on one element cannot effect the course of animations on 
          another element.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The start time of an animation refers to the time when the animation
          is specified to begin as recorded in the
          <code>TimedItem.startTime</code> property, that is, before applying
          any <var>start delay</var>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The stacking order of animations is independent of the
          current play direction of individual animations and animation
          groups.

      <section>
        <h3>Resolving Animation Stacks</h3>
        <p>
          In order to resolve an animation stack, an initial animation
          value is required for each element and property animated by the
          stack.
          To calculate a current animation value for elements and properties
          from an animation stack, an animation value is generated for each
          animation in the stack 
          (see <a href="#calculating-animation-values" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          The cumulative animation result for each element and property is first
          initialised to the relevant initial animation value.
          Starting at the bottom of the stack (i.e. earliest start time) and
          working up, as animation results are encountered for an element
          and property, these are merged into the cumulative animation result
          using the animation combinator stored in the 
          <code>AnimationEffect</code> that generated the result.
          Once all animation results in the stack are processed, the resulting
          cumulative animation values are the current animation values for
          each property of each element that is animated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Animation combinators</h3>
        <p>
          When an animation applies to a target and property that animations
          earlier in the animation stack have already applied to, the
          cumulative animation result from the stack is composited with the new
          animation to produce a new cumulative animation result.
          The possible combinators are defined by the <a>CompositeOperation</a>
          enumeration.

          <p>
            When an animation <code>a</code> is composited over a cumulative
            animation result <code>c</code> using the REPLACE combinator, the

            over a cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the
            ACCUMULATE combinator, the new cumulative animation result is the
            sum of <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, clipped if necessary to

            <code>(currentTime - parent.startTime)
            / parent.animationDuration</code>, where <code>parent</code> is the
            <code>AnimationTemplate</code> which references the

            When a path animation <code>a</code> is composited over a

            combinator, the effective transform of <code>a</code> is
            calculated.
            This transform is then interpolated with <code>c</code> using the
            rules provided in [[!CSS3-2D-TRANSFORMS]] to provide the new

      <h2>Animation templates</h2>
      <div class="informative">
      <p>
        It is sometimes necessary to apply the same animation effect to a series
        of targets.
        Animation templates provide a means for the same set of animation
        properties to be applied repeatedly to a number of targets
        whilst maintaining a link such that changes to the template are
        reflected at each place where the template is applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        In concrete terms, an <a>AnimationTemplate</a> object is used to create
        multiple <a>Animation</a> objects each of which maintains a link back to
        the template via its <code>template</code> property.
        Such <a>Animation</a> objects are said to be <dfn>linked</dfn> to
        a template.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timing and animation parameters of <a>linked</a> animations cannot
        be modified directly.
        Rather, changes are made to the template which is then echoed to all
        animations linked to the same template.
        In order to modify the timing and animation parameters of
        a <a>linked</a> animation directly, it must first be unlinked using the
        <code>unlink</code> method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that run-time properties of a <a>linked</a> animation such as its
        <var>start time</var> and <var>time drift</var> can still be modified.
        Only those properties attached to the <code>timing</code> and
        <code>effect</code> properties of a <a>linked</a> <a>Animation</a>
        object are read-only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlinked animations can be linked to a template by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>assigning the <var>template</var> property to an

        <li>calling <code>templatize</code> to create a new

      <h2>Timing events</h2>
      <p>
        As timed items play they report changes to their status through
        <a>TimingEvent</a>s.
      </p>
      <div class="annotation">
        <p><strong>Relationship to CSS and SVG events</strong></p>
        <p>
          CSS defines <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s and SVG defines <code>TimeEvent</code>s.
          The proposal here is to dispatch <a>TimingEvent</a>s in parallel to
          these events.
          This has the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is possible to register for <em>just</em> CSS animation events,
          or <em>just</em> CSS transition events, or <em>just</em> SVG time
          events, or <em>all</em> animation-related events
          (by registering for the timing events defined here).</li>
          <li>Backwards compatibility&mdash;existing content continues to work
          as is.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An alternative is to make CSS and SVG events subclass
          <a>TimingEvent</a> and just fire the one event.
          Two issues arrive with this.
          Firstly, the event type would change on the subclasses so it wouldn't
          be possible to catch all "start" events, for example.
          Secondly, the propagation path for SVG events is different since they
          are fired at the animation template element rather than the animation
          target element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there may be alternative approaches here such as
          augmenting CSS Animation events only and firing them from the API
          (although that may cause compatibility issues when SVG animations
          start reporting events to content expecting only CSS animations).

                I think document time will be much more useful than global time.
                For the rarer case that you want to synchronise animations
                between documents using events, I anticipate
                <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> will have a method to convert
                a document to global time and vice-versa and/or convert times
                from one <a>DocumentTimeSource</a> to another
                <a>DocumentTimeSource</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we come to define animations that aren't necessarily linked
                to a document time source we'll need to make this nullable or
                redefine it to mean "root time source".

              The <code>iterationTime</code> of the <a>TimeSource</a> with which

              For animations that do not belong to an <a>AnimationGroup</a> this
              will be equal to <code>documentTime</code>.

            <p class="annotation">
              If we allow animations to be associated with, for example,

              This is the most useful time space if, for example, you receive
              a timing event and want to add a new animation that synchronises
              with the item that dispatched the event by adding it to the same

            Other potential event types for a later version:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>pause</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever <code>paused</code> is newly true.<br>
              Use case: show a graphic overlay to mark a cartoon as paused.<br>
              Likewise <em>unpause</em>.</li>
            <li><em>seek</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever <code>currentTime</code> is set on the item or an
              ancestor.<br>
              Use case: Acts as a signal that intermediate events may have been
              dropped (see <a href="#event-dispatch-during-seeking"
              class="sectionRef"></a>).
              For example, if you have an iteration event handler that assumes
              it will get one call per iteration, then a seek event would be
              a cue that you need to check <code>iterationIndex</code> and
              adjust.
              Also, if you were implementing something like SVG's syncbase
              timing with script you often need to do some bookkeeping on
              a seek.
            </li>
            <li><em>directionchange</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever the effective direction of the item changes (due to
              the direction attribute, changes to playbackRate, calling reverse
              etc. on either the item or an ancestor)<br>
              Use case: update UI to represent rewinding;
              stop audio when playing backwards to prevent secretly encoded
              messages being revealed.
            </li>
            <li><em>newanimation</em> &mdash;
              fires whenever a new <a>Animation</a> object is created.
              Use case: a timeline debugger. You want to show all animations
              that are playing or yet-to-play.
              Using this event (and <code>document.getActiveAnimations</code>?)
              you could build up a timegraph.
              <p>
                I think this sort of event and this sort of use case would fit
                the MutationObserver pattern well.
                We could introduce a whole class of mutation records targetted
                at debugging (e.g. <em>timewindowchange</em>)
              </p>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, although this is a bit different to a regular event (since
            it's qualified by a parameter), it seems like it might be nice to be
            able to do something like:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
            anim.onprogress(0.8,
             function() {
              // Issue a request to prefetch the next episode
             });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It would be called whenever you got a sample where
            <code>iterationTime</code> &ge; <var>progress</var> was newly true.
          </p>
        </div>

          The <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#glossary-propagation-path">propagation
          path</a> for all events depends on the <a>TimedItem</a> where the
          status change took place.
          If the item is an <a>Animation</a> with an <a>AnimationEffect</a>
          <var>effect</var>, and <code><var>effect</var>.targetElement</code> is
          not <code>null</code>, the propagation path follows the usual <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow">DOM event
          flow</a> from <code>DefaultView</code> down the parent chain to
          <code><var>effect</var>.targetElement</code> and finally to the
          <a>TimedItem</a> where the status change took place.
          Otherwise, the propagation path is simply the <code>TimedItem</code>
          object itself.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that unlike <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s in CSS, and <code>TimeEvent</code>s in
          SVG which target an Element, the target of a <a>TimingEvent</a> is
          a <a>TimedItem</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Web Animations makes no guarantees about the time between
          successive frames of animation, it is possible that the time when
          a change in state that should produce an event is scheduled to occur
          does not line up with a frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, the events that should be dispatched when sampling the model
          is based on the interval between samples as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let <var>previous sample</var> be the moment when the timing model
            was last sampled, recorded in document time.
            If there was no previous sample, then let <var>previous sample</var>
            be -1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>current sample</var> be the current document time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>progress interval</var> be the interval (<var>previous
            sample</var>, <var>current sample</var>].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The events to be dispatched are therefore those whose document time
          lies within <var>progress interval</var>.

            animation interval starts at t=2s, and then conduct another sample
            at t=4s, the <em>timingstart</em> event should fire even though the
            event's document time lies outside the progress interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could possibly fix this by making the previous sample times and
            current sample times per-<a>TimedItem</a> but that won't work for
            repeating groups.
            Needs work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            This last part here requires calculating document times (both for
            testing against the progress interval and also for filling in the
            <code>documentTime</code> property of the event) and that's hard to
            calculate since our current model allows non-invertible timing
            functions on groups.
            That means you can't easily just traverse the descendants (by child
            and iteration) and generate a list of interval and iteration
            boundaries then filter out the ones that don't fit in the interval
            because you can't easily convert from local time to document time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can, of course, convert from document time to local time
            and while that's probably enough to tell if there was an interval or
            iteration edge or not, it's not enough to determine the exact time
            at which it occurred (to fill in the event parameters).
          </p>
          <p>
            A complex example is where you have an group whose iteration time
            goes from 0 to 1.5 to 0.7 back to 1.
            Suppose you have a child animation that finishes its animation
            interval at 80% of the way through the parent's iteration interval.
            It would then finish, do nothing, then start reversing part-way,
            then finish again.
            In that case I think you expect to get: start, finish, start,
            finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's probably not impossible, so long as we allow for the fact that
            the inverse may have several (even equal) roots but it sounds tricky
            and possibly expensive to calculate on each iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think we might need to re-consider allowing non-invertible timing
            functions on groups.
            Alternatively we could say that the children of a group with
            a non-interval timing function don't generate events.
            Or, alternatively again, that they occur on the non-transformed
            times.
          </p>
          <p>
            This final options of making event times untransformed times is not
            such a bad option, especially if we split time transformations into
            a separate step and perhaps even a separate interface.
            It's similar to some vector graphics editing programs that provide
            bitmap filter effects&mdash;often the bounding box of the filtered
            shape reflects the dimensions of the vector shape and not that of
            the bitmapped result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, in the case of an animation that bounces back and forth before
            resting at its final value, it's probably more useful to get just
            one end event when it finally rests than lots of little end/start
            events each time it crosses the 1.0 iteration time boundary.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            One implementation issue with events is that sometimes you find you
            suddenly have a large backlog of events to dispatch and this may
            have an adverse impact on performance.
            Some such situations include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have a short iteration duration, e.g. 50ms, then you get put
              in a background tab and throttled really low.
              On the next sample, you might have hundreds of iteration events to
              dispatch.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have an arrangement of animations such that they keep spawning
              new ones for ever.
              You can easily get this in SVG using syncbase timing or in the
              model here by using repeating groups.
              In this case, you can have a lot of events to dispatch if you get
              throttled low.
              Once you have a global clock, you also encounter this situation
              when the computer goes to sleep since when it wakes up it will
              have a lot of start/end/iteration events to catch up on.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It seems like the Mutation Observer pattern might help here except,
            firstly, that might prevent simple usage such as:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate({ opacity: '0%' }, 1).onend =
   function() { elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem); };
          </pre>
          <p>
            Secondly, even using the observer pattern doesn't relieve the
            implementation of having to walk through the model and determine
            all the mutations that have occured and their corresponding times
            and this could be expensive if the computer has been asleep for
            a few days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option might be to set some implementation requirements that
            allow dropping events or automatic pausing when the time between
            samples is protracted (such as the device going to sleep).

        <h3>Event dispatch during seeking</h3>
        <p>
          The previous description of event dispatch applies when the timing
          model is sampled during normal playback (whether forwards or
          backwards).
          However, when a seek is performed by setting the
          <code>currentTime</code> of a <a>TimedItem</a>,
          a different behavior is employed.
          In effect, event dispatch is supressed until the seek is completed.
          After the seek has completed, events are dispatched based on comparing
          the before and after state of each <a>TimedItem</a> affected by the
          seek.
          Iteration events are not dispatched.
        </p>
        <p class="annotation">
          Supressing events during seeking is necessary to provide performant
          seeking.
          It is also arguably the more intuitive behavior as, for example,
          when rewinding a cartoon one probably does not expect a bucketload of
          events to arrive as a result of traversing backwards over each
          <a>TimedItem</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Should iteration events be dispatched?
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Define a <a>TimedItem</a> as <dfn>active</dfn> if and only if
            <code>currentTime</code> &ge; <code>timing.startDelay</code> and
            <code>currentTime</code> &lt; <code>timing.startDelay</code> +
                                          <code>animationDuration</code>.</li>
          <dd></dd>
          <li>Prior to performing the seek on <var>item</var>,
              record whether it is <a>active</a> or not.</li>
          <li>If <var>item</var> is an <a>AnimationGroup</a> record whether each
              descendent <a>TimedItem</a> is <a>active</a> or not.</li>
          <li>Perform the seek as described in <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
          <li>For each <a>TimedItem</a> considered in steps 2 and 3, compare
              whether the item was <a>active</a> before the seek and
              whether it is <a>active</a> now and dispatch events as follows:
              <dl class="switch">
                <dt>If the item was previously <a>active</a> but, after seeking,
                    is no longer <a>active</a>,</dt>
                <dd>Dispatch a new <code>timingend</code> event with
                  <a>localTime</a> set to <code>endTime</code> and
                  <a>documentTime</a> set to the corresponding document
                  time.
                  <span class="todo">(Obviously this depends on being able
                    to convert from a local time to a document time as
                    discussed in the previous section.)
                </dd>
                <dt>If the item was previously not <a>active</a> but, after
                    seeking, is now <a>active</a>,</dt>
                <dd>Dispatch a new <code>timingstart</code> event with
                  <a>localTime</a> set to <code>startTime
                  + timing.startDelay + timeDrift</code> and
                  <a>documentTime</a> set to the corresponding document
                  time.
                </dd>

        <p>
          The sequence of dispatched events is identical to that of events
          dispatched during regular sampling (see <a href="#sequence-of-events"

        <h3>Sequence of events</h3>
        <p>
          <a>TimingEvent</a>s are categories as <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#sync-async">synchronous
          events</a> whose sequence is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Events are ordered by <code>documentTime</code></li>
          <li>For events with the same <code>documentTime</code>,
              sort by event type from first to last as follows:
              <em>timingcancel</em>, <em>timingend</em>,
              <em>timingiteration</em>, <em>timingstart</em>.
              <p class="note">
                Note that sorting end events before start events is consistent
                with the end-point exclusive nature of timing in Web
                Animations (see <a href="#interval-timing"
                class="sectionRef"></a>).
                When animation A ends at the same time as animation B begins,
                we can imagine that animation A ends an incredibly short amount
                of time before animation B begins such that there is no overlap.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            For events with the same <code>documentTime</code> and type,
            if the target <a>TimedItem</a>s participate in a tree made up of
            <a>AnimationGroup</a>s then the events are dispatched as if the tree
            was sampled breadth-first such that events attached to ancestor
            <a>TimedItem</a>s are dispatched first.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="issue">
          What if the order is still unresolved, is it okay to leave it
          undefined?
          Can we use document order or script order here?
          It's tempting to use the same order as we use for compositing but
          remember that not everything that is timed is composited (e.g.
          groups).

      <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Discarding past animations</h3>
        <p>
          If implementations are required to preserve all state associated with
          animations then the resources required by an animation could continue
          to increase without limit over time. For long-running animations, and
          particularly those where animations are added dynamically, this could
          lead to degraded performance and eventual failure.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            I'm not sure how to define this. We could say all animations with
            <code><var>end time converted to document time</var> &lt;
            <var>current document time</var> - 5min</code> can be discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, but what about crazy documents that put 1 million
            animations in a 5min span? Just leave that up to the browser.
            Also, what about mobile clients, is 5 min too long? Is this too
            prescriptive?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe, just make some suggestions (e.g. 1 min for mobile clients,
            5 min for desktop?) and then define an exception to throw if there
            is a seek to some time outside that window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, note that defining this in terms of past intervals is
            direction-specific but that's probably ok since most long-running
            animations will run forwards.
