      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines features for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform by means of a programming interface.
        This interface is intended to be used both directly to easily produce
        animations using script, as well as a foundation for other
        specifications whose behavior can be defined in terms of these features.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a web page.
          Although the three specifications provide similar functionality,
          the syntaxes are incompatible and the animations cannot be
          interchanged.
          Furthermore, the interfaces available for interacting with animations
          from script are largely general-purpose interfaces with few features
          tuned specifically to the creation and manipulation of animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification proposes an abstract animations model that
          encompasses the abilities of both CSS and SVG, and additionally
          provides a programming interface to expose these features to script.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding specification,
          which describes how CSS features can be implemented in terms of Web 
          Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification, which
          describes how SVG features can be implemented in terms of Web
          Animations primitives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, this specification does not directly alter the behavior
          of CSS Transitions, CSS Animations, or SVG.
          However, Web Animations is intended to replace the SMIL Animation
          [[SMIL-ANIMATION]] specification where it is currently used to define
          the behavior of SVG's animation features.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification makes some additions to some interfaces defined in
          HTML5 [[HTML5]].

      <h2>Web Animations overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, Web Animations consists of two largely independent
        pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation model</em>.
        The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of Web Animations.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces the
        values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100 pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width for
        the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to the
        animation model.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is entirely
          independent of previous inputs, the model may be described as
          stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are two apparent exceptions to the stateless behavior of the
          timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, events are fired when, for example, one sample falls
          on the opposite side of an animation's interval boundary to the
          previous sample.
          This is certainly stative behavior.
          However, events should be considered as a layer added on top of the
          core timing model.
          In the case where no event listeners are registered, the model is
          stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other exception to this stateless behavior is that a number of
          methods such as <code>pause</code> and <code>reverse</code> are
          defined in terms of the time at which they are called and are
          therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but, like events, are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the API,
          it has no influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not
          conflict with the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          In effect, time begins with real world time (a monotonically
          increasing time source) and cascades down a number of steps to each
          animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <p class="todo">
          Need diagram here.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, schedule, accelerated and so
          on, as a whole since the manipulations applied to the parent cascade
          down to its descendants.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          otherwise independent animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this notion of inherited time, some features are implemented
          outside of the time hierarchy.
          In particular, synchronisation with HTML's media controllers (see <a
          href="#synchronizing-with-media" class="sectionRef"></a>) requires
          mirroring changes to pause state between items in different branches
          of the time hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in this hierarchy is the animation timeline.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The animation timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Each document contains a timeline to which animations may be added.
        These animations have an interval during which they are scheduled to
        animate.
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timeline.svg" width="600">

      <p class="caption">

        Animation C has finished animating.
        Animation D has yet to begin and is not animating.

      <p>
        The start time of the timeline is defined in <a
        href="#start-of-the-timeline" class="sectionRef"></a>.

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Animations in the timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Animations in the timeline are represented by <code>Animation</code>
        objects.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The <code>Animation</code> interface</h3>
        <dl title="interface Animation : TimedItem" class="idl">

            <dl class="parameters">

              <dd>
                The target element.
                This may be <code>null</code> for animations that do not target
                a specific element.
              </dd>
              <dt>object animationFunction</dt>
              <dd>
                The animation function used to set the
                <code>animationFunction</code> property of the newly created
                <a>Animation</a> object.
                <p>
                  If this parameter is an <a>AnimationFunction</a> object or
                  <a>CustomAnimationFunction</a> object, it will shared with any
                  other <a>Animation</a> objects referring to the same
                  <a>AnimationFunction</a> or <a>CustomAnimationFunction</a>
                  object.
                  It will <em>not</em> be copied.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Otherwise, if this parameter is any other type of object, it
                  will be passed to <a

                  and the resulting <a>AnimationFunction</a> object used as the

                The timing properties of the new animation.
                <p>
                  If this parameter is a <code>double</code>, then it
                  specifies the duration of a single iteration of the animation,
                  that is, the <a>iteration duration</a>, in seconds.
                  In this case, the <code>timing</code> property of the new
                  <a>Animation</a> object is set to a new <a>Timing</a> object
                  with all properties set to their default values as specified
                  on the <a>TimingDictionary</a> dictionary definition except
                  the <code>duration</code> property which is set to the value
                  specified here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If this parameter is of type <a>TimingDictionary</a>, then the
                  passed-in dictionary is used to construct a new <a>Timing</a>
                  object which is then assigned to the <code>timing</code>
                  property of the new <a>Animation</a> object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, if this parameter is a <a>Timing</a> object, it is

                  It is <em>not</em> copied.
                  In this way <a>Timing</a> objects can be shared between

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            To specify further timing properties such as the playback rate,
            a <a>TimingDictionary</a> can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            To share or re-used timing properties with another animation,
            a <a>Timing</a> object can be directly passed in as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Share the timing properties of animB with animA
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, animB.timing);

// Re-use the timing properties of animB in animC without sharing
var animC = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, animB.timing.clone());
          </pre>
          <p>
            The animation function parameter may specify multiple properties,
            an <a>AnimationFunction</a> object, or even a callback object.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 5);

// Share the animation function of another animation
var animB = new Animation(elem, animA.animationFunction, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation function
var animC = new Animation(elem, new PathAnimationFunction( ... ), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation function
var animC = new Animation(elem,
  { 
    sample: function(time) { 
      if (time !== null) {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
      } else {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0;
      }
    },
    clone: function { return this; }
  }, 3);

          <p class="todo">

        <h3>The animation interval</h3>
        <p>
          The period that an animation is animating is called the
          <dfn>animation interval</dfn>.
          Each animation has only one such interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the animation interval is determined by the
          <dfn>start time</dfn> of the animation but may be shifted by
          a <dfn>start delay</dfn> on the animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>animation
          duration</a>.

        <p>
          The relationship between the <a>start time</a>, <a>start delay</a>,

        <h3>Animation fill behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of the <a>animation interval</a>, an animation may still
          affect its target depending on its <dfn>fill mode</dfn>.
          The different modes are as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>none</dt>
          <dd>
            The animation does not affect its target outside of the

          </dd>
          <dt>forwards</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur later than the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will continue to apply to its target the
            animation value that was used at the end of the <a>animation
            interval</a>.

            For times that occur before the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will not affect its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>backwards</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur before the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will apply the same animation value that will be used at
            the start of the <a>animation interval</a>.

            For times that occur later than the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            animation will not affect its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>both</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur before the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            backwards fill behavior is used.

            For times that occur after the <a>animation interval</a>, the
            forwards fill behavior is used.
          </dd>
        </dl>

          (b) fill mode &lsquo;forwards&rsquo;. After the animation interval has
              finished, the animation continues to apply a fill value to the
              target.<br>
          (c) fill mode &lsquo;backwards&rsquo;. The animation applies a fill

          At a given time, it is possible to describe an animation as <dfn>in

          Note that setting a fill mode has no bearing on the endpoints of the

          However, the fill mode <em>does</em> have an effect on the
          calculation of the <a>animation time</a> and consequently the
          <a>iteration time</a> since these are defined only when the animation

        <h3>Animation repeat behavior</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that an animation's effect should repeat
          a fixed number of times or even indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>animation
          interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>animation interval</a>, an animation can have multiple
          <a>iteration interval</a>s although typically only the interval
          corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <a>iteration
          duration</a>. Comparing the <a>iteration duration</a> and the
          <a>animation duration</a> we have:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Iteration duration</dt>
          <dd>
            The time taken for a single iteration of the animation to complete.
          </dd>
          <dt>Animation duration</dt>
          <dd>
            The time taken for the entire animation effect to complete,
            including repetitions.
            This may be longer or shorter than the iteration duration.

          Times in Web Animations are relative to some point of reference. These

          This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer

        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces, when animation groups are used (see
          <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization" class="sectionRef"></a>) we
          can talk about the <dfn>parent iteration time space</dfn>.
          The zero time of <a>parent iteration time space</a> is the beginning
          of the parent animation group's <a>current iteration</a>.
          When animation groups are not used, this is equivalent to <a>document
          time space</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, <a>item time space</a> is used for operations confined to
          a single animation such as <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item">seeking</a>
          and <a href="pausing-a-timed-item">pausing</a> whilst <a>parent
          iteration time space</a> is used to synchronize animations in a group
          and hence is the time space used to represent an animation's start and
          end time.
          <a>Animation time space</a> is not used directly in the Web Animations
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these time spaces are illustrated below.
        </p>

          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web

          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <a>animation time space</a>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>animation time</a> defined in <a

          never return a negative value.

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          For intervals of time, Web Animations uses an endpoint-exclusive
          timing model. This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not. In interval
          notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>. This model
          provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and sequenced
          since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated animation, at animation time
          1s, the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced animation, in the absence of any fill mode,
          at parent iteration time 1s, only animation B can affect its target;
          there is no overlap.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/endpoint-exclusive-timing.svg" width="600">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Illustration of end-point exclusive timing. For both repeated and
          sequenced animations there is no overlap at the boundaries between
          intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#animation-fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
          href="#calculating-the-unscaled-iteration-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and is illustrated below.

          After one iteration, the first frame of the animation is shown, but

        <h3>Specifying timing properties</h3>
        <p>
          Timing properties are collected under the <code>Timing</code>
          interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this object is attached to a linked <a>Animation</a> or
          <a>AnimationGroup</a> (see <a href="#animation-templates"
          class="sectionRef"></a>) then it is readonly and attempting to set any
          of its properties will result in a DOMException of type
          <code>NoModificationAllowedError</code> being thrown.
          In order to modify the properties of a readonly object, it is
          necessary to first call the <code>unlink</code> method on the
          corresponding <a>Animation</a> or <a>AnimationGroup</a> object.
        </p>
        <p>
          When throwing a DOMException as a result of attempting to set
          a readonly property, <a>user agent</a>s that provide debugging
          feedback SHOULD also provide feedback indicating the reason that this
          object is readonly and the remedy described above.

              <code>null</code> (e.g. because <code>parentGroup</code> is
              <code>null</code>, or because the parent is not <a>in effect</a>)
              a parent time of zero is used.
              This allows the item to be seeked prior to being attached to
              a group.

          <li>
            If <code><a>item time</a> &lt; timing.startDelay</code>

        <h3>Calculating the iteration time</h3>
        <p>
          The iteration time is calculated by first applying the animation's
          <code>playbackRate</code> and <code>iterationStart</code> properties
          to produce the <a>adjsuted animation time</a>
          The <a>adjusted animation time</a> is then divided into intervals
          resulting in the <a>unscaled iteration time</a>.
          Following this, timing manipulations specified on the timed item are
          applied to the <a>unscaled iteration time</a> to produce the
          <a>iteration time</a>.

          <p>
            Before the <a>animation time</a> can be converted to an <a>iteration
            time</a> we must factor in the animation's <var>playback rate</var>
            and <var>iteration start</var>.
            This is called the <a>adjusted animation time</a>.

            define the <a>start offset</a> as follows:

            Timed items may be paused and resumed independently of the parent
            animation group they belong to.
            The effect is that the time of the item lags behind that of its
            parent.
            This lag is called the <var>time drift</var> and acts as an
            additional delay added to the <var>start time</var> of the item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Timed elements that do not have a parent animation group may still
            be paused and resumed.
            However, except for the case of the document timeline, there will be
            no observable effect until the element is attached to a parent
            animation group.
          </p>

        <p>
          Pausing and seeking are realised using two additional inputs to the

          <code>timeDrift</code> property on the <a>TimedItem</a> interface, and
          the <dfn>pause start time</dfn> which is internal to the model.
          Both the <var>time drift</var> and <var>pause start time</var> are
          initially zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pausing behavior is realised through the specific steps defined

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Seeking, like pausing, has the effect of causing a timed item's
            time to drift from that of its parent animation group.
            Consequently, it is also uses the <a>time drift</a> and
            <a>pause start time</a> concepts on which pausing is based.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Seeking is performed in response to a change to a timed item's
          <code>currentTime</code> property and is realised by adjusting the
          <code>timeDrift</code> property or the internal <a>pause start

      <h2>Scaling the time</h2>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which an animation
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the animation to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides a variety of timing
          functions that scale the progress of an animation.
          In situations where the timing functions defined here are
          insufficient, it is possible to provide a custom script-based timing
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all cases, timing functions take an input time and produce a scaled
          output time.
        </p>
        <p class="todo">
          Diagram
        </p>
        <p>
          Such timing functions can be applied to an iteration of an animation
          as a whole via the <a>TimedItem</a> interface or to a segment of
          a keyframe animation via the <a>KeyframeAnimationFunction</a>

        <h3>Scaling using a cubic Bézier curve</h3>
        <p>
          A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
          curve to scale the time.
          The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0,0) and (1,1) while two
          control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of the
          curve.
          Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
          lie within the range [0,1] such a curve produces a function that is
          used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
          (the <var>y</var> values).
          This arrangement is illustrated below.

        <h3>Timing in discrete steps</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to scale an animation's timing so that the animation
          occurs in a series of discrete steps using a stepping function.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stepping function divides the input time into a specified number of
          intervals that are equal in duration.
          The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount equal to the
          interval duration once during each interval at the transition point
          which may be either the start, midpoint, or end of the interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          In keeping with Web Animation's model for endpoint exclusive interval
          timing (see <a href="#interval-timing" class="sectionRef"></a>), the
          output time at the transition point is the time <em>after</em>
          applying the increase (i.e. the top of the step).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some example step timing functions are illustrated below.
        </p>

            Need help from someone who knows math.
            We'd like to be able to have a function with many extrema.
            Ideally, something like Catmull-Rom curves would be great where you
            could just say:

          <p>
            <tt>[ 0: 0, 0.7: 1, 0.8: 0.9, 1: 1 ]</tt>

          <p>
            And you'd get a smooth curve that goes to the full value and bounces
            back a bit then finishes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trouble is that Catmull-Rom curves won't necessarily give you
            a function even if you sort the <var>x</var> values.

      </p>
      <p>

          an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider repetition. If a group has an iteration count
          of 2, then the children of of the group will all play twice since they
          effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.

          Since children of an animation group base their timing on the group's
          <var>iteration time</var>, when the group repeats, the children play
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an iteration count is specified for the children of a group as well
          as for the group the effect is as if the iteration count of the group
          was multiplied with the iteration count of the children.

        <p>
          A further result of the children of a group basing their timing on the
          group's <var>iteration time</var> is that they cannot animate outside
          of the group's <a>animation interval</a>.
          This is because the <var>iteration time</var> of a group will not
          change outside its animation interval.
          This allows groups to clip the playback of their children.

          a specified duration it has the effect of clipping the animation's
          duration.

        <p>
          Some further consequences of group children basing their timing on

            Changing the playback direction of an animation group will change

          Groups can be used to provide synchronization behavior for its
          children.
          For example, one type of group runs its children in parallel, whilst
          another type runs the children in sequence.

        <p>
          We have previously referred to the document timeline as the context in
          which animation takes places.
          Likewise we have referred to the <em>document time space</em> as the
          master time space which contains other time spaces.
          The document timeline is, in fact, a parallel animation group
          with the following special properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It cannot be appended as a child of another group. As a result the
            <code>parentGroup</code> property returns <code>null</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calls to <code>cancel()</code> will result in a DOMException of type
            HierarchyRequestError being thrown.

          <li>
            <p>
              For properties that represent times in <em>parent iteration time

            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, the <var>parent iteration time</var> is the number of

          <h4>Initial state of the document timeline</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike other timed items, the document timeline is initially paused.
            The moment at which the timeline becomes unpaused is defined in <a
              href="#start-of-the-timeline" class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On creating an <code>AnimationGroupInstance</code> corresponding to
            the document timeline, the following steps are performed.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Set the <var>start time</var> to the current <var>parent
              iteration time</var> (i.e. the number of seconds since 00:00:00
              UTC on 1 January 1970).
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the <var>pause state</var> to <code>true</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            By setting the <var>start time</var> to the <var>parent iteration
            time</var> and then pausing the timeline, the start time is always
            well-defined.
            Furthermore, seeking the timeline before it is unpaused provides
            intuitive results without special casing the algorithm for seeking
            (see <a href="#seeking-a-timed-item" class="sectionRef"></a>).

          <h4>Start of the timeline</h4>
          <p>
            The time at which the timeline will be automatically unpaused is
            determined by the <code>timelineStart</code> property on the
            <code>Document</code> object (see <a
            href="#extensions-to-the-document-interface"
            class="sectionRef"></a>). It can have the following values:

            <dt>onload</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The moment immediately prior to dispatching the "load" event for
                the document.
              </p>
              <p>
                For HTML documents, this is the moment after the <a
                  href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/dom.html#current-document-readiness">current
                  document readiness</a> has changed to "complete" but before
                dispatching the load event.  In terms of the timings defined in
                <a
                  href="http://test.w3.org/webperf/specs/NavigationTiming/">NAVIGATION-TIMING</a>
                <span class="todo">(Need to add NAVIGATION-TIMING to the
                  biblio)</span>, this occurs between the <em>domComplete</em>
                and <em>loadEventStart</em> timings.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the default value.

                The moment after the user agent stops parsing but before running
                scripts that are designated to execute when parsing finishes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For HTML documents, this occurs after updating the <a
                  href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/dom.html#current-document-readiness">current
                  document readiness</a> to "interactive" (see <a

                specified behavior for the end of parsing</a>), that is,
                after the <em>domInteractive</em> timing.

              A moment infinitely distant in the future. That is, animation will
              not begin until <code>unpause</code> is called on the timeline.

          <p>
            For the <var>onload</var> and <var>onstart</var> values, it is not
            sufficient to simply the record the appropriate time and seek the
            animations accordingly at a later moment.
            Rather, the timeline must be actually unpaused at the appropriate
            moment such that scripts that execute during page loading (for
            example, in response to the load event) can make assumptions about
            the pause state of the timeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any call to <code>pause</code> or <code>unpause</code> on the
            timeline disables the automatic unpause behavior defined by the
            <code>timelineStart</code> property on the document.
            It is as if the <code>timelineStart</code> property were set to
            <var>manual</var>.

          <div class="note">
            <p>
              The ability for script to override the <code>timelineStart</code>

              with SVG.
            </p>
            <p>
              This override behavior applies even if the timeline has already
              been unpaused since changing the <code>timelineStart</code>
              property could return the timeline to a state where the automatic

          <p>
            The start time for the children of a sequence animation group
            is calculated according to the following procedure:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let the <var>accumulated start time</var> be zero.
            <li>
              Iterate over each child in the group beginning with the first item
              in the group and proceeding to the last.
              For each child perform the following steps:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Let <var>child</var> be the current child.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let <code><var>child</var>.startTime</code> be
                  <var>accumulated start time</var>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let <var>accumulated start time</var> be
                  <code><var>child</var>.endTime</code>.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            When <code>animationDuration</code> is positive infinity the
            behavior is defined by IEEE 754-2008.
            As a result, if any of the children of a sequence animation group
            has an infinite animation duration, any children that occur
            later in the sequence will not play.

          The output of each <em>animation function</em> is then combined using

            Need to define convenience ctors here. I think you want to support
            something like this:

          <pre class="sh_javascript">

  [
    { offset: 0,   height: '200px' },
    { offset: 0.2, height: '300px', timing: 'ease-in' },
    { offset: 1,   height: '400px' },
  ]
}</pre>
          <p>
            If <code>offset</code> is not specified it makes them equidistant?
            That assumes they're in order though.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, ideally the ctor for <a>GroupedAnimationFunction</a> would
            accept the above input as well as the below.

            value</var> for that animation at given current time <var>t</var> 
            is calculated by following the procedure outlined in

            treating the list of <code>AnimationFunction</code> objects

        <h3>Custom animation functions</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            In some situations the animation functions provided by Web
            Animations may be insufficient.
            For example, the animation functions defined here are only able to
            target certain CSS properties and DOM attributes.
            They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
            href="#http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
            property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
            affecting the document content.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases where the provided animation functions do not provided
            needed functionality, an animation function defined by script may be
            used.
            Such animation functions receive a time fraction from the timing
            model and are responsible for producing the animation effect
            corresponding to the specified time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using an animation function defined in script it is possible to
            animate not only previously un-animatable attributes and properties,
            but potentially anything that is accessible via script, including
            even producing audio or creating vibrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, using an animation function that draws to a <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
            element it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
            featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
            SVG.
            Compared to using the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
            interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
            independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
            accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
            in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
            additional programming.
          </p>
        </div> <!-- informative -->
        <div class="annotation">
          <p>
            I think we want two types of custom animation functions.
            Following is the general-purpose animate-anything kind of function.
            The other type, which is not defined here, is the one that can
            participate in the animation sandwich just like any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            This, second, native-like animation function, would have the
            following features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shares the same function signature as
                <code><a>AnimationFunction</a>.sample</code></li>
            <li>Gets passed the underlying value and passes out the animated
                value.</li>
            <li>Has a target property and is sorted against other
                <a>AnimationFunction</a> objects (including platform
                objects)</li>
            <li>Can be added as a child of
                a <a>GroupedAnimationFunction</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That's a bit more difficult since you have to be careful that the
            custom function doesn't do anything naughty while you're in the
            middle of compositing the animation sandwich.
            I think we should postpone this until Web Animations 2.

          <h4>Execution order of custom animation functions</h4>
          <p>
            Custom animation functions allow authors to define animation effects
            using script.
            Such animation functions are not limited to a single CSS property or
            DOM attribute and therefore the steps for assessing their order of
            execution differs from regular animation functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Custom animation functions are executed after all other
            <a>AnimationFunction</a> objects have completed and applied their
            effects to their targets.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Need to define this more precisely.
            Are styles flushed?
            Presumably they are.
            Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
            animation functions and just do it once afterwards?
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the set of custom animation functions, the order of execution
            is mostly the same as that for other animation functions and is
            defined in <a href="#the-global-animation-stack"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
            However, custom animation functions may also override this
            ordering through the <code>priority</code> attribute, which, if
            defined, specifies the priority of the functions with lower numbers
            are executed sooner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In deciding which of two <a>CustomAnimationFunction</a> functions,
            <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, should be executed the following
            rules are applied.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> based on their
                <code>priority</code> such that lower priorities are sorted
                first.
                If either does not have a defined <code>priority</code>,
                then treat the priority as being positive infinity for the
                purposes of sorting.</li>
            <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority,
                sort according to the <code>startTime</code>s of the
                <a>TimedItem</a>s with which <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are
                associated such that earlier start times are sorted first.
            <li>If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same priority and
                start time, sort by the position of the corresponding
                <a>Animation</a> objects occur within the animation tree (see
                issue below).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Items sorted earlier, are executed first.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            That last point is quite wrong. I don't think we've specified
            exactly what script order is in <a
            href="#the-global-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>.
            But I wonder if it makes more sense to effectively enumerate all the
            script-based nodes in the animation tree using some well-defined
            order and use that index.
            Can that be done efficiently?

            Might be an additional parameter to add later if it proves
            necessary?
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            I think we will also need to pass the previous time fraction.
            Animations will often use this to check if they are paused, playing
            in reverse etc.
            They can track this themselves but then you need a separate object
            everywhere you use it.

        <h3>The Global Animation Stack</h3>
        <p>
          When multiple <a>in effect</a> animations target the same element, the
          animations are ordered into a stack which resolves how those 
          animations combine.
          This stack is sorted by animation <var>start time</var>.
          Where multiple animations have the same start time, those animations
          are sorted in document order (for animations from the DOM) and script
          order (for animations from the API). Script animations are always
          sorted after DOM animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other operations also generate animation stacks - for example, 
          grouping multiple animations using a 
          <code>GroupedAnimationFunction</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An animation stack may be thought of as a single stack with all
          animations sorted into it, or a stack per animating element, as
          animations on one element cannot effect the course of animations on 
          another element.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The start time of an animation refers to the time when the animation
          is specified to begin as recorded in the
          <code>TimedItem.startTime</code> property, that is, before applying
          any <var>start delay</var>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The stacking order of animations is independent of the
          current play direction of individual animations and animation
          groups.

      <section>
        <h3>Resolving Animation Stacks</h3>
        <p>
          In order to resolve an animation stack, an initial animation
          value is required for each element and property animated by the
          stack.
          To calculate a current animation value for elements and properties
          from an animation stack, an animation value is generated for each
          animation in the stack 
          (see <a href="#calculating-animation-values" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          The cumulative animation result for each element and property is first
          initialised to the relevant initial animation value.
          Starting at the bottom of the stack (i.e. earliest start time) and
          working up, as animation results are encountered for an element
          and property, these are merged into the cumulative animation result
          using the animation combinator stored in the 
          <code>AnimationFunction</code> that generated the result.
          Once all animation results in the stack are processed, the resulting
          cumulative animation values are the current animation values for
          each property of each element that is animated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Animation combinators</h3>
        <p>
          When an animation applies to a target and property that animations
          earlier in the animation stack have already applied to, the
          cumulative animation result from the stack is composited with the new
          animation to produce a new cumulative animation result.
          The possible combinators are defined by the <a>CompositeOperation</a>
          enumeration.

          <p>
            When an animation <code>a</code> is composited over a cumulative
            animation result <code>c</code> using the REPLACE combinator, the

            ACCUMULATE combinator, the new cumulative animation result is the

            <code>(currentTime - parent.startTime)
            / parent.animationDuration</code>, where <code>parent</code> is the
            <code>AnimationTemplate</code> which references the
            <code>AnimationFunction</code> that is being composited.

            When a path animation <code>a</code> is composited over a
            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the MERGE
            combinator, the effective transform of <code>a</code> is
            calculated.
            This transform is then interpolated with <code>c</code> using the
            rules provided in [[!CSS3-2D-TRANSFORMS]] to provide the new
            cumulative animation result.

      <h2>Animation templates</h2>
      <div class="informative">
      <p>
        It is sometimes necessary to apply the same animation effect to a series
        of targets.
        Animation templates provide a means for the same set of animation
        properties to be applied repeatedly to a number of targets
        whilst maintaining a link such that changes to the template are
        reflected at each place where the template is applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        In concrete terms, an <a>AnimationTemplate</a> object is used to create
        multiple <a>Animation</a> objects each of which maintains a link back to
        the template via its <code>template</code> property.
        Such <a>Animation</a> objects are said to be <dfn>linked</dfn> to
        a template.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timing and animation parameters of <a>linked</a> animations cannot
        be modified directly.
        Rather, changes are made to the template which is then echoed to all
        animations linked to the same template.
        In order to modify the timing and animation parameters of
        a <a>linked</a> animation directly, it must first be unlinked using the
        <code>unlink</code> method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that run-time properties of a <a>linked</a> animation such as its
        <var>start time</var> and <var>time drift</var> can still be modified.
        Only those properties attached to the <code>timing</code> and
        <code>animationFunction</code> properties of a <a>linked</a>
        <a>Animation</a> object are read-only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlinked animations can be linked to a template by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>assigning the <var>template</var> property to an
        <a>AnimationTemplate</a> <span class="todo">(Is this right? Are we going
        to do this?)</span>, or</li>
        <li>calling <code>templatize</code> to create a new
        <a>AnimationTemplate</a> with properties set to reflect the current
        state of the <a>Animation</a> object on which it is called.</li>

      <h2>Animation events</h2>
      <div class="todo">
        <p>
          Need to consider how to align with existing
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s, <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TimeEvent</code>s. It might make sense to have our events
          inherit from one or more of these interfaces or have implementations
          dispatch both (especially if their synchronization properties differ).
        </p>
        <p>
          I think we might also want a seek event? It seems like a lot of
          applications will want to do bookkeeping when there's
          a seek&mdash;especially a backwards seek. It might also be necessary
          for the SVG bindings so you can clear certain events on a backwards
          seek as required by SMIL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talk about what events are dispatched on a seek.
          It's probably important that we don't dispatch intermediate events
          during a seek as then implementations will be required to step through
          each interval and it breaks the fact that skipping around the model is
          constant time.
          It's also not what SVG does, i.e. SVG skips events during a seek.
          I think you just want to record the animating vs non-animating state
          of each item before the seek, then compare to after the seek and fire
          the appropriate event.
          (Do groups fire events?)

        <h3>Synchronizing event handlers</h3>
        <div class="todo">
          <p>
            The proposal to-date is as follows.
            Requirements for dispatch of animation events:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Animations triggered by an event handler appear to have started at
              the time the event was scheduled to be triggered.
            </li>
            <li>
              No effect of an animation for any time 't' can be reflected in
              style, DOM or animation object until any animation event handlers
              associated with dispatch times at or before 't' have returned from
              execution.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>In effect this is roughly the same as saying:</p>
          <blockquote>
            When event handlers due to  animation events run, the state of the
            world (DOM properties etc.) so  far as it is influenced by
            animation, is as if the current time was the time when the event was
            scheduled to be triggered.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            There may be many ways to realise this, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              dispatching animation events synchronously
            </li>
            <li>
              careful updating of the animation time (after waiting for
              corresponding animation events to return)
            </li>
            <li>
              pausing the world
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Shane and Tab feel that this approach is not very webby, and might
            be going to too much effort in order to support a programming
            model that should be discouraged.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the current model, the animation timeline is essentially
            static unless modified by script, which means that interrogating
            this timeline for information should be safe even in the absence
            of enforced synchronization.
            So if correct handling of an event requires precise knowledge
            about which animations have started or finished, then the timeline
            can be inspected at the time given in the event. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, triggering animations off complex functions involving
            current animation state is probably not the right way to go - 
            instead some kind of model of the state should be used and the
            animations derived from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, in the absence of strong use cases for synchronous events
            we feel we should go with a simpler model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some alternative approaches are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Standard asynchronous events with no guarantees about the
              state of the world when event handlers are called.
            </li>
            <li>
              Event logs like those proposed to replace DOM events.

        For transforms I think it's defined elsewhere so we can either just

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>

        The Media Fragments specification [[MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.  For resources
        containing content animated with Web Animations the application of the
        temporal parameters is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a begin time is specified, perform a seek on the document
            timeline passing in the specified begin time as the seek time (see

          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Note that seeking behavior is well-defined even when the document
            has yet to start and hence the seek can be performed regardless of

          (In order to be consistent with how hyperlinks work elsewhere such as
          document anchors, svg views, etc.)
          Perhaps we just make it an interal thing for now and in a future

        <h3>Discarding past animations</h3>
        <p>
          If implementations are required to preserve all state associated with
          animations then the resources required by an animation could continue
          to increase without limit over time. For long-running animations, and
          particularly those where animations are added dynamically, this could
          lead to degraded performance and eventual failure.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            I'm not sure how to define this. We could say all animations with
            <code><var>end time converted to document time</var> &lt;
            <var>current document time</var> - 5min</code> can be discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, but what about crazy documents that put 1 million
            animations in a 5min span? Just leave that up to the browser.
            Also, what about mobile clients, is 5 min too long? Is this too
            prescriptive?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe, just make some suggestions (e.g. 1 min for mobile clients,
            5 min for desktop?) and then define an exception to throw if there
            is a seek to some time outside that window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, note that defining this in terms of past intervals is
            direction-specific but that's probably ok since most long-running
            animations will run forwards.
