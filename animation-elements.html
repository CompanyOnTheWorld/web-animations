    <section id='abstract'>
      This specification defines an element-based markup for defining
      animation and time-related changes to a Web page.
      It is intended to replace the animation features of <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG 1.1</a> by building on the model
      defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/">Web
      Animations</a>.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="todo">TBD</p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Use cases</h2>
        <h4>Tweening and cutout animation</h4>
        <p>
          A common animation technique involves taking some graphical elements
          and interpolating their properties such as position or color or moving
          them along a path.
          This is sometimes referred to as <em>cutout animation</em> since the
          moving parts were traditionally represented by separate shapes cut
          from cardboard or similar material.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in the following segment of a cartoon, a golfer swings
          his arms (and club!) and as a result the golf ball follows
          a trajectory through the air before bouncing along the ground.
        </p>
        <pre class='example sh_html'>
&lt;path id="golferBody" d="&hellip;"/&gt; 
&lt;g id="armsAndClub"&gt;
  &lt;path id="club" d="&hellip;"/&gt; 
  &lt;path id="arms" d="&hellip;"/&gt; 
&lt;/g&gt;
&lt;circle id="ball" &hellip;/&gt;
&lt;seq&gt;
  &lt;!-- Rotate man's arms and club --&gt;
  &lt;animate href="armsAndClub" attributeName="transform"
    values="rotate(0); rotate(-120); rotate(30); rotate(0)"
    keyTimes="0; 0.5; 0.8; 1" additive="sum" dur="1.2s"/&gt;
  &lt;!-- Show course of ball --&gt;
  &lt;animateMotion href="ball" begin="-0.312s" path="&hellip;"/&gt;
&lt;/seq&gt;
        </pre>
        <h4>Timesheets</h4>
        <p>
          In simple examples such as the above cartoon, it is useful to
          represent graphical content and timing side-by-side.
          However, for applications that involve complex sequencing of effects
          it is often convenient to separate the temporal markup into a separate
          subtree or document sometimes referred to as
          a &ldquo;timesheet&rdquo;&mdash;the temporal equivalent of
          a stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a timesheet may define animations directly or simply set classes
          and define the animation effects using, for example, CSS Animations
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the title screen and first scene of an interactive
          story might use the following timesheet:
        </p>
        <pre class='example sh_html'>
&lt;!-- Title screen --&gt;
&lt;seq begin="0s"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Draw curtains to the side --&gt;
  &lt;par&gt;
    &lt;animate href="leftCurtain" attributeName="transform"
      to="translate(-100 0)" dur="1s" additive="sum"/&gt;
    &lt;animate href="rightCurtain" attributeName="transform"
      to="translate(100 0)" dur="1s" additive="sum"/&gt;
  &lt;/par&gt;
  &lt;!-- Then show the title by setting a class which may trigger,
       for example, a fade animation defined in CSS --&gt;
  &lt;set href="title" attributeName="class" to="active"/&gt;
&lt;/seq&gt;

&lt;!-- Show the first scene when the user clicks the title screen --&gt;
&lt;seq begin="titleScreen.click" restart="whenNotActive"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Cross fade to show background --&gt;
  &lt;par&gt;
    &lt;animate href="titleScreen" attributeName="opacity" to="0" dur="1s"/&gt;
    &lt;animate href="scene1Background" attributeName="opacity" to="1" dur="1s"/&gt;
  &lt;/par&gt;
  &lt;!-- Move narrator onstage --&gt;
  &lt;animate href="narrator" attributeName="transform"
    to="translate(180 90)" dur="0.3s"/&gt;
  &lt;!-- Set the active class on the narrator which may trigger further
       animations or perhaps update the pointer-events property so he
       becomes clickable--&gt;
  &lt;set href="narrator" attributeName="class" to="active"/&gt;
&lt;/seq&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          The triggers for these effects can be defined declaratively as in
          the example above or they can be applied using script (see the
          <code>playWith</code> method).
        </p>
        <div class="feedbackWanted">
          <p>
            For more complex usage such as an interactive comic book the
            following features would be useful:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to define a &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; (which may or may not
                be a type of <code>&lt;seq&gt;</code>) where each step is
                gated on certain conditions (e.g. mouse clicks or keyboard
                presses).
            <li>Ability to step backwards through such a sequence.
            <li>Ability to define alternative animations when stepping
                backwards.
            <li>Ability to step forwards causing the current in-play step to
                skip to its end and triggering the next step.
            <li>Ability to hyperlink to a particular step (including when steps
                when such steps are nested)
          </ul>
          <p>
            The features currently defined in this specification can be used to
            realize some of these sort of use cases but typically it is
            quite cumbersome.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible to extend this specification to cover the above
            features or we can defer it and introduce a more fully-featured
            state tracking feature in a subsequent version.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Round-trip ad-hoc animation</h4>
        <p>
          When performing DOM manipulation, it is often useful to attach
          animation to an element in such a form that it can be serialized for
          later playback and editing.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a presentation authoring tool allows a user to select
          items on a slide and tween their various properties at different times
          or in response to events such as mouse clicks.
          This could be achieved by annotating the element in question with
          a child element as follows:
        </p>
        <pre class='example sh_html'>
&lt;image&gt;
  &lt;animate begin="3s" dur="1s" attributeName="opacity" to="1" fill="forwards"/&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          In many cases, such an approach is easier to generate and re-parse
          than doing so with stylesheet animation:
        </p>
        <pre class='example sh_html'>
&lt;image&gt;
  &lt;style scoped&gt;
    image {
      animation: fadeIn 1s 3s forwards;
    }
    @keyframes fadeIn {
      to {
        opacity: 1.0;
      }
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
        </pre>
        <h4>Frame-based animation</h4>
        <p>
          Rather than smoothly tweening values, sometimes it is desirable to
          overlay a series of independent images in quick succession.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a children's workshop teaching animation principles
          allows children to draw a series of similar images and then show and
          hide them in turn creating the illusion of movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supposing each drawn image is contained in an SVG
          <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element, the animation could be produced as
          follows:
        </p>
        <pre class='example sh_html'>
  &lt;!-- Graphical content --&gt;
  &lt;g class="frame" visibility="hidden"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;g class="frame" visibility="hidden"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;g class="frame" visibility="hidden"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;g class="frame" visibility="hidden"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/g&gt;

  &lt;!-- Timing --&gt;
  &lt;seq repeatCount="indefinite"&gt;
    &lt;set select=".frame" dur="0.2s" attributeName="visibility" to="visible"/&gt;
  &lt;/seq&gt;
        </pre>
        <h4>Animated user interface widgets</h4>
        <p>
          User interface widgets are often accompanied by animated effects that
          provides affordances to the user.
          These effects should be defined in a manner that allows re-use across
          a variety of similar widgets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, following is a re-usable definition of mouse hover
          effects applied to some content representing a button.
        </p>
        <pre class='example sh_html'>
&lt;!-- A button-like object --&gt;
&lt;g role="button"&gt;
  &lt;rect &hellip; /&gt;
  &lt;text filter="child"&gt;
    &lt;filter &hellip; /&gt;&hellip;&lt;feGaussianBlur &hellip; /&gt;&lt;/filter&gt;
    Button label
  &lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/g&gt;

&lt;!-- A complex mouseover effect --&gt;
&lt;par select="g[role=button]" begin="mouseover" end="mouseout"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Tween background color of button --&gt;
  &lt;animate select="rect" attributeName="fill" to="blue" dur="0.3s" fill="forwards"/&gt;
  &lt;seq&gt;
    &lt;!-- Wiggle text to the side --&gt;
    &lt;animate select="text" attributeName="transform" dur="0.3s"
      additive="sum" values="translate(0); translate(-10); translate(0)"/&gt;
    &lt;!-- Then make it glow by tweaking part of the filter --&gt;
    &lt;animate select="feGaussianBlur" attributeName="stdDeviation"
      from="0" to="2" fill="forwards" dur="0.3s"/&gt;
  &lt;/seq&gt;
&lt;/par&gt;

&lt;!-- Fade out button background on mouseout --&gt;
&lt;par select="g[role=button]" begin="mouseout" end="mouseover; indefinite"&gt;
  &lt;animate select="rect" begin="mouseout" attributeName="fill"
    to="navy" dur="0.3s" fill="forwards"/&gt;
  &lt;set select="feGaussianBlur" attributeName="stdDeviation" to="0"/&gt;
&lt;/par&gt;
        </pre>
        <div class="annotation">
          This use case would also benefit from the custom reversing suggested
          for timesheets / interactive comics.

      <section>
        <h2>Relationship to SVG 1.1 Animation</h2>
        <p>
          This specification is intended to be backwards-compatible with the
          animation features defined in SVG 1.1 Second Edition [[SVG11]] with
          the following exceptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The special behavior of a frozen to-animation has been altered to
              follow the regular behavior of the model since no user agent
              implemented the specified behavior.
          <li>The procedure for resolving syncbase dependencies and particularly
              breaking cyclic dependencies has been rewritten in a manner that
              may produce slight variations in some circumstances.
              This was done because the previous definition was incredibly vague
              and as a result was implemented inconsistently in every user
              agent.
          <li>The <span class="elem">animateColor</span> element has been
              removed since it was deprecated in SVG 1.1.
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following features defined in SVG 1.1 have been deprecated in this
          specification:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <span class="elem">animateTransform</span> element.
              This is because the <span class="elem">animate</span> element is
              now able to animate transform lists which produces more
              predictable behavior that avoids many of the issues surrounding
              <span class="elem">animateTransform</span>.
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following additional features not present in SVG 1.1 have been
          added to this specification:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All features are now defined in terms of the Web Animations
              [[WEBANIMATIONS]] model providing a consistent foundation for
              applications also using CSS-based animations or the Web Animations
              API.
              This also makes it possible for the author to programmatically
              inspect and modify the animations generated by the markup defined
              in this specification.
          <li>The <span class="elem">par</span> and
              <span class="elem">seq</span> elements have been introduced to
              provide more powerful synchronization behavior that avoids many of
              the problems associated with syncbase timing such as being unable
              to cancel a chain of animations or seek a document in constant
              time.
              These elements also facilitate re-use of complex animation
              definitions.
          <li>Animation elements now include the <span
              class="attr">select</span> attribute for targetting a range of
              elements making animations re-useable.
          <li>The <span class="attr">href</span> attribute no longer requires
              the XLink namespace in keeping with changes made in SVG 2.0.
          <li>The <span class="attr">cancel</span> attribute has been added to
              completely remove an animation or a group of animations including
              fill effects when its conditions are met.
          <li>The <span class="attr">reverse</span> attribute has been added to
              specify conditions that cause and animation or a group of
              animations to change direction.
          <li>The <span class="attr">repeatStart</span> attribute has been added
              to allow starting an animation part-way through its interval.
          <li>The <span class="attr">speed</span> attribute has been added to
              control the playback rate of animations and groups including
              reversing them.
          <li>The <span class="attr">easing</span> and <span
              class="attr">easing-times</span> attributes have been added to
              allow specifying easing behavior using a common syntax to CSS and
              Web Animations including the ability to specify step timing
              functions.
          <li>The <span class="attr">fill</span> attribute has been extended to
              support the &lsquo;backwards&rsquo;, &lsquo;both&rsquo;, and
              &lsquo;auto&rsquo; values.
          <li>The <span class="elem">discard</span> element has been added so
              that long-running animations can manually remove no-longer needed
              resources and provide more performant playback, particularly on
              resource-constrained devices.
          <li>The <span class="attr">timelineStart</span> attribute has been
              added to allow starting animations prior to the document load
              event such as &ldquo;spinner&rdquo; and progress-bar animations
              shown during page load.
          <li>The <code>playWith</code> method has been added to the interface
              for animation elements (more specifically,
              <code>TimedElement</code>) to allow applying the animation defined
              by such an element to an arbitrary target element.

        <h2>Relationship to SMIL Animation</h2>
        <p>
          To the extent that this specification is backwards-compatible with SVG
          1.1's animation features, most of which are defined in terms of SMIL
          Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]], this specification defines many features
          similar to those defined in SMIL Animation.
          However, since such features are fully-defined either in this
          specification or in Web Animations [[!WEBANIMATIONS]], this
          specification does not make any normative reference to SMIL Animation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Relationship to Web Animations</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the features defined in this specification are defined in
          terms of the Web Animations [[!WEBANIMATIONS]] model which serves as
          a normative reference for this specification.

      <h2>Timed elements</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines a number of elements that share common timing
        behavior referred to as <dfn title="timed element">timed elements</dfn>.
        The common timing features of timed elements are described first
        followed by the specific elements.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The <a>timed elements</a> defined by Animation Elements act as
          templates for creating animations and timing groups as defined by
          [[!WEBANIMATIONS]].
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship between <a>timed elements</a> and Web Animations'
          timed items is one-to-many since:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>multiple elements may be targetted (for example,
              <code>select="div.warning"</code>),
          <li>animation triggers may match multiple times (for example,
              <code>begin="2s; 5s; click"</code>),
          <li>automatically-generated reverse effects are realized by separate
              timed items (for example <code>reverse="mouseout"</code>), and
          <li>a timed element can be applied to an arbitrary target using the
              <code>playWith</code> method which will generate further timed
              items.
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Namespace</h2>
        <p>
          The <a>timed elements</a> defined in this specification belong to the
          SVG namespace as defined in [[!SVG11]].
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>If SVG2 allows SVG elements to exist outside the SVG namespace then
             we will reflect that here as well.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, SVG2 aside, it may be worth investigating allowing
             these elements directly in HTML.</p>

        <h2>Attributes to identify the target elements for a timed element</h2>
        <p>
          Each <a>timed element</a> maintains a list of <dfn>target
          elements</dfn> for which it generates timed items.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following attributes are the <dfn>target element attributes</dfn>
          which specify the <a>target elements</a> for a <a>timed element</a>.
        </p>
        <p><em>Attribute definitions:</em></p>

          A <a>timed element</a> where one or more of the <a>target element
          attributes</a> is specified is said to have a <dfn>specified
          target</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of <a>target elements</a> of a <a>timed element</a> without
          a <a>specified target</a> consists of a single item which is the
          <a>timed element</a>'s parent element if it has one, or an empty list
          otherwise.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          If we allow these elements in HTML we'll need to make sure that the
          parent here refers to the bound parent in case the actual parent is
          a <span class="elem">template</span> element.
        </p>
        <p>
          If more than one of the <a>target element attributes</a> is specified
          then the attribute with the highest precedence is used even if its
          value is empty or invalid; the other attributes are ignored.
          <span class="attr">select</span> has the highest precedence followed
          by <span class="attr">href</span> then <span
          class="attr">xlink:href</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resolution of <a>target element attributes</a> is performed in the
          context of the <dfn>scope document</dfn>.
          The <a>scope document</a> is the <a
          href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document">node
          document</a> of the <a>timed element</a>.

          I think for seamless iframes we don't need any special handling since
          they probably shouldn't reach up into the host document.

        <p>
          The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
          for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
          The application of the temporal parameters to documents with the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a> 
          [[!SVG11] is as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is a begin time, seek the document controller to
              the begin time at the earliest of two moments: when the document
              begins to play or document load.
              <p class="note">
                Note that seeking behavior is well-defined even when the
                document has yet to start.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>If there is an end time, set a flag on the controller to say
              auto-pause at the given time.</li>
          <li>Any calls to seek / pause / play etc. on that controller clear the
              flag.</li>
          <li>If the controller reaches (or passes) the end time and the flag is
              still set, call pause and clear the flag.</li>

        <p class="todo">

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
          their MIME type.
          As a result, temporal addressing may not have any effect for SVG
          content that is served in a document with a MIME type other than the
          SVG MIME type such as SVG embedded in HTML.
